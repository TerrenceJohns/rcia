  <p align="center"><font color="#663300"><b>for the approval and publication<BR>of the <i>Compendium<BR></i>of the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i></b></font></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To my Venerable Brothers the Cardinals, Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops, 
Priests, Deacons and to all the People of God.</p>
  <p>Twenty years ago, work began on the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> that 
had been requested by the extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops held on 
the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican 
Council.</p>
  <p>I am filled with heartfelt thanks to the Lord God for having given the Church 
this <i>Catechism,</i> promulgated in 1992 by my venerated and beloved 
Predecessor, Pope John Paul II.</p>
  <p>The great value and beauty of this gift are confirmed above all by the extensive 
and positive reception of the <i>Catechism</i> among Bishops, to whom it was 
primarily addressed as a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic 
doctrine and, in particular, for formulating local catechisms.&nbsp; But it was also 
confirmed by its vast favourable reception in all segments of the People of God, 
who have come to know and appreciate it in more than fifty translations which to 
date have been published.</p>
  <p>It is with great joy that I now approve and promulgate the <i>Compendium</i> of 
that <i>Catechism. </i></p>
  <p>The <i>Compendium</i> had been fervently desired by the participants in the 
International Catechetical Congress of October 2002, which gave voice to a need 
widely felt in the Church.&nbsp; My beloved Predecessor, recognizing this desire, 
decided in February 2003 to begin preparation of the text by entrusting the work 
to a Commission of Cardinals, over which I presided, and which was assisted by 
various experts.&nbsp; In the course of the work, a draft of the <i>Compendium</i> 
was submitted to all the Cardinals and the Presidents of Conferences of Bishops, 
the vast majority of whom evaluated the text favourably.</p>
  <p>The <i>Compendium,</i> which I now present to the Universal Church, is a 
faithful and sure synthesis of the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church.</i>&nbsp; It 
contains, in concise form, all the essential and fundamental elements of the 
Church"s faith, thus constituting, as my Predecessor had wished, a kind of <i>
vademecum</i> which allows believers and non-believers alike to behold the 
entire panorama of the Catholic faith.</p>
  <p>In its structure, contents and language, the <i>Compendium</i> faithfully 
reflects the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i> and will thus assist in 
making the <i>Catechism</i> more widely known and more deeply understood.</p>
  <p>I entrust this <i>Compendium</i> above all to the entire Church and, in 
particular, to every Christian, in order that it may awaken in the Church of the 
third millennium renewed zeal for evangelization and education in the faith, 
which ought to characterize every community in the Church and every Christian 
believer, regardless of age or nationality.</p>
  <p>But this <i>Compendium,</i> with its brevity, clarity and comprehensiveness, is 
directed to every human being, who, in a world of distractions and multifarious 
messages, desires to know the Way of Life, the Truth, entrusted by God to His 
Son"s Church.</p>
  <p>Through the intercession of Mary Most Holy, Mother of Christ and Mother of the 
Church, may everyone who reads this authoritative text recognize and embrace 
ever more fully the inexhaustible beauty, uniqueness and significance of the 
incomparable Gift which God has made to the human race in His only Son, Jesus 
Christ, the "Way, the Truth, and the Life" (<i>Jn</i> 14:6).</p>
  <p>Given on 28 June 2005, the vigil of the Solemnity of the Holy Apostles Peter and 
Paul, in the first year of my Pontificate.</p>
  <p align="center"><b>BENEDICTUS PP. XVI</b>&nbsp;</p>
  <hr>
  <p align="center"><b><font size="4" color="#663300"><a name="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></font></b></p>
  <p>1. On 11 October 1992, Pope John Paul II presented the <i>Catechism of the 
Catholic Church</i> to the faithful of the whole world, describing it as a 
"reference text"<a href="archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></a> 
for a catechesis renewed at the living sources of the faith. Thirty years after 
the opening of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), the desire for a 
catechism of all Catholic doctrine on faith and morals, which had been voiced in 
1985 by the extraordinary Assembly of the Synod of Bishops,&nbsp; came to fulfilment. 
  </p>
  <p>Five years later, on 15 August 1997, the Pope promulgated the <i>editio typica</i> 
of the <i>Catechismus Catholicae Ecclesiae</i> and confirmed its fundamental 
purpose "as a full, complete exposition of Catholic doctrine, enabling everyone 
to know what the Church professes, celebrates, lives and prays in her daily 
life".<a href="archive_2005_compendium-ccc_en.html#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></a></p>
  <p>2. In order to realize more fully the <i>Catechism"s</i> potential and in 
response to the request that had emerged at the International Catechetical 
Congress of October 2002, Pope John Paul II, in 2003, established a Commission 
under the presidency of Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, Prefect of the Congregation 
for the Doctrine of the Faith, which was given the task of drafting a <i>
Compendium</i> of the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church,</i> as a more concise 
formulation of its contents of faith.&nbsp; After two years of work, a <i>draft 
compendium</i> was prepared and distributed among the Cardinals and the 
Presidents of Conferences of Bishops for their consultation.&nbsp;The draft, as a 
whole, was evaluated positively in the great majority of the responses that were 
received.&nbsp;Therefore, the Commission proceeded to revise the draft and, taking 
account of the proposals for improvement that had been submitted, prepared the 
final text.</p>
  <p>3. There are three principal characteristics of the <i>Compendium</i>: the close 
reliance on the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>; the dialogical format; 
the use of <i>artistic images</i> in the catechesis.</p>
  <p>The <i>Compendium </i>is not a work that stands alone, nor is it intended in any 
way to replace the <i>Catechism of the Catholic Church</i>: instead, it refers 
constantly to the <i>Catechism</i> by means of reference numbers printed in the 
margins, as well as by consistent reliance on its structure, development and 
contents. In fact, the <i>Compendium</i> is meant to reawaken interest in and 
enthusiasm for the <i>Catechism, </i>which, in the wisdom of its presentation 
and the depth of its spirituality, always remains the basic text for catechesis 
in the Church today.</p>
  <p>Like the <i>Catechism</i>, the <i>Compendium </i>has four parts, corresponding 
to the fundamental laws of life in Christ.</p>
  <p>The first part, entitled "The Profession of Faith", contains a synthesis of the
<i>lex credendi,</i> the faith professed by the Catholic Church, as expressed in 
the Apostles" Creed which is further elaborated by the Nicene-Constantinopolitan 
Creed. In the liturgical profession of the Creed, the Christian assembly keeps 
the principal truths of the faith alive in memory.</p>
  <p>The second part, entitled "The Celebration of the Christian Mystery", presents 
the essential elements of the <i>lex celebrandi.</i> The proclamation of the 
Gospel finds its authentic response in the sacramental life, through which 
Christians experience and witness, in every moment of their existence, the 
saving power of the paschal mystery by which Christ has accomplished our 
redemption.</p>
  <p>The third part, entitled "Life in Christ", recalls the <i>lex vivendi</i>, 
through which the baptized manifest their commitment to the faith they have 
professed and celebrated, through their actions and ethical choices.&nbsp;The 
Christian faithful are called by the Lord Jesus to act in a way which befits 
their dignity as children of the Father in the charity of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p>The fourth part, entitled "Christian Prayer", summarizes the<i> lex orandi,</i> 
the life of prayer. Following the example of Jesus, the perfect model of one 
who prays, the Christian too is called to the dialogue with God in prayer.&nbsp;A 
privileged expression of prayer is the <i>Our Father,</i> the prayer that Jesus 
has taught us.</p>
  <p>4. A second characteristic of the <i>Compendium</i> is its dialogical format, 
reflecting the ancient catechetical literary genre of questions and answers.&nbsp;The idea is to reproduce an imaginary dialogue between master and disciple, 
through a series of incisive questions that invite the reader to go deeper in 
discovering ever new aspects of his faith.&nbsp;The dialogical format also lends 
itself to brevity in the text, by reducing it to what is essential.&nbsp;This may 
help the reader to grasp the contents and possibly to memorize them as well.</p>
  <p>5. A third characteristic is the inclusion of some artistic images which mark 
the elaboration of the <i>Compendium.</i>&nbsp;These are drawn from the rich 
patrimony of Christian iconography. The centuries-old conciliar tradition 
teaches us that images are also a preaching of the Gospel. Artists in every age 
have offered the principal facts of the mystery of salvation to the 
contemplation and wonder of believers by presenting them in the splendour of 
colour and in the perfection of beauty. It is an indication of how today more 
than ever, in a culture of images, a sacred image can express much more than 
what can be said in words, and be an extremely effective and dynamic way of 
communicating the Gospel message.</p>
  <p>6. Forty years after the close of the Second Vatican Council and in the year of 
the Eucharist, this <i>Compendium</i> represents an additional resource for 
satisfying the hunger for truth among the Christian faithful of all ages and 
conditions, as well as the hunger for truth and justice among those who are 
without faith.&nbsp; The publication of the <i>Compendium </i>will take place on the 
solemnity of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul, pillars of the Church universal 
and exemplary evangelizers of the ancient world.&nbsp; These apostles saw what they 
preached and witnessed to the truth of Christ even unto martyrdom.&nbsp; Let us 
imitate them in their missionary zeal and pray to the Lord that the Church may 
always follow the teaching of the apostles, from whom she first received the 
glorious proclamation of the faith.</p>

  <p><b>1. What is the plan of God for man?</b></p>
  <p>1-25</p>
  <p>God, infinitely perfect and blessed in himself, in a plan of sheer goodness 
freely created man to make him share in his own blessed life. In the fullness of 
time, God the Father sent his Son as the Redeemer and Savior of mankind, fallen 
into sin, thus calling all into his Church and, through the work of the Holy 
Spirit, making them adopted children and heirs of his eternal happiness<i>.</i></p>

    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"You are great, O Lord, and greatly to be praised [...] You have 
made us for yourself and our heart is restless until it rests in you." </i>(Saint 
Augustine)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>2. Why does man have a desire for God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>27-30<BR>44-45</p>
  <p>God himself, in creating man in his own image, has written upon his heart the 
desire to see him. Even if this desire is often ignored, God never ceases to 
draw man to himself because only in God will he find and live the fullness of 
truth and happiness for which he never stops searching. By nature and by 
vocation, therefore, man is a religious being, capable of entering into 
communion with God. This intimate and vital bond with God confers on man his 
fundamental dignity.</p>
  <p><b>3. How is it possible to know God with only the light of human reason?</b></p>
  <p>31-36<BR>46-47</p>
  <p>Starting from creation, that is from the world and from the human person, 
through reason alone one can know God with certainty as the origin and end of 
the universe, as the highest good and as infinite truth and beauty.</p>
  <p><b>4.  Is the light of reason alone sufficient to know the mystery of God?</b></p>

  <p>In coming to a knowledge of God by the light of reason alone man experiences 
many difficulties. Indeed, on his own he is unable to enter into the intimacy of 
the divine mystery. This is why he stands in need of being enlightened by God"s 
revelation, not only about those things that exceed his understanding, but also 
about those religious and moral truths which of themselves are not beyond the 
grasp of human reason, so that even in the present condition of the human race, 
they can be known by all with ease, with firm certainty and with no admixture of 
error.</p>
  <p><b>5. How can we speak about God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>39-43<br>
  48-49</p>
  <p>By taking as our starting point the perfections of man and of the other 
creatures which are a reflection, albeit a limited one, of the infinite 
perfection of God, we are able to speak about God with all people.  We must, however, continually purify our language insofar as it is image-bound 
and imperfect, realizing that we<i> </i>can never fully express the infinite 
mystery of God. </p>

  <p><b>6. What does God reveal to man?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>50-53<br>
  68-69</p>
  <p>God in his goodness and wisdom reveals himself. With deeds and words, he reveals 
himself and his plan of loving goodness which he decreed from all eternity in 
Christ. According to this plan, all people by the grace of the Holy Spirit are 
to share in the divine life as adopted "sons" in the only begotten Son of God.</p>
  <p><b>7. What are the first stages of God&#39;s Revelation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>54-58<br>
  70-71</p>
  <p>From the very beginning, God manifested himself to our first parents, Adam and 
Eve, and invited them to intimate communion with himself. After their fall, he 
did not cease<i> </i>his revelation to them but promised salvation for all their 
descendants. After the flood, he made a covenant with Noah, a covenant between 
himself and all living beings. </p>
  <p><b>8. What are the next stages of God&#39;s Revelation?</b></p>
  <p>59-64<br>
  72</p>
  <p>God chose Abram, calling him out of his country, making him "the father of a 
multitude of nations" (<i>Genesis</i> 17:5), and promising to bless in him "all the 
nations of the earth" (<i>Genesis</i> 12:3). The people descended from Abraham would be 
the trustee of the divine promise made to the patriarchs. God formed Israel as 
his chosen people, freeing them from slavery in Egypt, establishing with them 
the covenant of Mount Sinai, and, through Moses, giving them his law. The 
prophets proclaimed a radical redemption of the people and a salvation which 
would include all nations in a new and everlasting covenant. From the people of 
Israel and from the house of King David, would be born the Messiah, Jesus.</p>
  <p><b>9. What is the full and definitive stage of God&#39;s Revelation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>65-66<br>
  73</p>
  <p>The full and definitive stage of God"s revelation is accomplished in his Word 
made flesh, Jesus Christ, the mediator and fullness of Revelation. He, being the 
only-begotten Son of God made man, is the perfect and definitive Word of the 
Father. In the sending of the Son and the gift of the Spirit, Revelation is now 
fully complete<i>,</i> although the faith of the Church must gradually grasp its 
full significance over the course of centuries.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"In giving us his Son, his only and definitive Word, God spoke 
everything to us at once in this sole Word, and he has no more to say."</i> (Saint 
John of the Cross)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>10. What is the value of private revelations?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>67</p>
  <p>While not belonging to the deposit of faith, private revelations may help a 
person to live the faith as long as they lead us to Christ. The Magisterium of 
the Church, which has the duty of evaluating such private revelations, cannot 
accept those which claim to surpass or correct that definitive Revelation which 
is Christ.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300" size="4">The Transmission of Divine Revelation</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>11. Why and in what way is divine revelation transmitted?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>74</p>
  <p>God "desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth" (<i>1 
Timothy</i> 2:4), that is<i>,</i> of Jesus Christ. For this reason, Christ must be 
proclaimed to all according to his own command, "Go forth and teach all nations" 
(<i>Matthew</i> 28:19). And this is brought about by Apostolic Tradition.</p>
  <p><b>12. What is Apostolic Tradition?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>75-79,<BR>83,<BR>96, 98</p>
  <p>Apostolic Tradition is the transmission of the message of Christ, brought about 
from the very beginnings of Christianity by means of preaching, bearing witness, 
institutions, worship, and inspired writings. The apostles transmitted all they 
received from Christ and learned from the Holy Spirit to their successors, the 
bishops, and through them to all generations until the end of the world.</p>
  <p><b>13. In what ways does Apostolic Tradition occur?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>76</p>
  <p>Apostolic Tradition occurs in two ways: through the living transmission of the 
word of God (also simply called Tradition) and through Sacred Scripture which is 
the same proclamation of salvation in written form.</p>
  <p><b>14. What is the relationship between Tradition and Sacred Scripture?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>80-82<BR>97</p>
  <p>Tradition and Sacred Scripture are bound closely together and communicate one 
with the other. Each of them makes present and fruitful in the Church the 
mystery of Christ. They flow out of the same divine well-spring and together 
make up<i> </i>one sacred deposit of faith from which the Church derives her 
certainty about revelation.</p>
  <p><b>15. To whom is the deposit of faith entrusted?</b></p>
  <p>84, 91<br>
  94, 99</p>
  <p>The Apostles entrusted the deposit of faith to the whole of the Church. Thanks 
to its supernatural sense of faith the people of God as a whole, assisted by the 
Holy Spirit and guided by the Magisterium of the Church, never ceases to 
welcome, to penetrate more deeply and to live more fully from the gift of divine 
revelation.</p>
  <p><b>16. To whom is given the task of authentically interpreting the deposit of 
faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>85-90<br>
  100</p>
  <p>The task of giving an authentic interpretation of the deposit of faith has been 
entrusted to the living teaching office of the Church alone, that is, to the successor of Peter, the Bishop of Rome, and to the bishops in 
communion with him. To this Magisterium, which in the service of the Word of God 
enjoys the certain charism of truth, belongs also the task of defining dogmas 
which are formulations of the truths contained in divine Revelation. This 
authority of the Magisterium also extends to those truths necessarily connected 
with Revelation.</p>
  <p><b>17. What is the relationship between Scripture, Tradition and the Magisterium?</b></p>
  <p>95</p>
  <p>Scripture, Tradition, and the Magisterium are so closely united with each other 
that one of them cannot stand without the others.  Working together, each in its own way, under the action of the one Holy Spirit, 
they all contribute effectively to the salvation of souls.</p>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300" size="4">Sacred Scripture</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>18. Why does Sacred Scripture teach the truth?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>105-108<o:p><br>
  135-136</o:p></p>
  <p>Because God himself is the author of Sacred Scripture. For this reason it is 
said to be inspired and to teach without error those truths which are necessary 
for our salvation. The Holy Spirit inspired the human authors who wrote what he 
wanted to teach us. The Christian faith, however, is not a "religion of the 
Book", but of the Word of God " "not a written and mute word, but incarnate and 
living" (Saint Bernard of Clairvaux).</p>
  <p><b>19. How is Sacred Scripture to be read?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>109-119<br>
  137</p>
  <p>Sacred Scripture must be read and interpreted with the help of the Holy Spirit 
and under the guidance of the Magisterium of the Church according to three 
criteria: 1) it must be read with attention to the content and unity of the 
whole of<i> </i>Scripture; 2) it must be read within the living Tradition of the 
Church; 3) it must be read with attention to the analogy of faith, that is, the 
inner harmony which exists among the truths of the faith themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p><b>20. What is the <i>Canon</i> of Scripture?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>120&nbsp;<br>
  138</p>
  <p>The <i>Canon</i> of Scripture is the complete list of the sacred writings which 
the Church has come to recognize through Apostolic Tradition. The <i>Canon</i> 
consists of 46 books of the Old Testament and 27 of the New.</p>
  <p><b>21. What is the importance of the Old Testament for Christians?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>121-123&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Christians venerate the Old Testament as the true<i> </i>word of God. All of the 
books of the Old Testament are divinely inspired and retain a permanent value. 
They bear witness to the divine pedagogy of God&#39;s saving love. They are written, 
above all, to prepare for the coming of Christ the Savior of the universe.</p>
  <p><b>22. What importance does the New Testament have for Christians?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>124-127&nbsp;<br>
  139</p>
  <p>The New Testament<i>,</i> whose central object is Jesus Christ, conveys to us 
the ultimate truth of divine Revelation.  Within the New Testament the four Gospels of Mathew, Mark, Luke and John are the 
heart of all the Scriptures because they are the principle witness to the life 
and teaching of Jesus. As such, they hold a unique place in the Church.</p>
  <p><b>23. What is the unity that exists between the Old and the New Testaments?</b></p>
  <p>128-130&nbsp;<br>
  140</p>
  <p>Scripture is one insofar as the Word of God is one. God"s plan of salvation is 
one, and the divine inspiration of both Testaments is one. The Old Testament 
prepares for the New and the New Testament fulfills the Old; the two shed light 
on each other.</p>
  <p><b>24. What role does Sacred Scripture play in the life of the Church? </b>
  </p>
  <p><b></b>131-133&nbsp;<br>
  141-142</p>
  <p>Sacred Scripture gives support and vigor to the life of the Church. For the 
children of the Church, it is a confirmation of the faith, food for the soul and 
the fount of the spiritual life. Sacred Scripture is the soul of theology and of 
pastoral preaching. The Psalmist says that it is "a lamp to my feet and a light 
to my path" (<i>Psalm</i> 119:105). The Church<i>,</i> therefore, exhorts all to read 
Sacred Scripture frequently because "ignorance of the Scripture<i>s </i>is 
ignorance of Christ" (Saint Jerome).</p>

God</a></b></font></p>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300">I Believe</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>25. How does man respond to God who reveals himself?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>142-143</p>
  <p>Sustained&nbsp;by divine grace, we respond to God with the obedience of faith, which 
means the full surrender of ourselves to God and the acceptance of his truth 
insofar as it is guaranteed by the One who is Truth itself. </p>
  <p><b>26.  Who are the principal witnesses of the obedience of faith in the Sacred 
Scriptures?</b></p>
  <p>144-149&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are many such witnesses, two in particular: One is <i>Abraham</i> who when 
put to the test "believed in God" (<i>Romans</i> 4:3) and always obeyed his call. For 
this reason he is called "the Father of all who believe" (<i>Romans</i> 4:11-18). The 
other is the <i>Virgin Mary</i> who, throughout her entire life, embodied in a 
perfect way the obedience of faith: "<i>Let it be done to me according to your 
word</i>" (<i>Luke</i> 1:38).</p>
  <p><b>27. What does it mean in practice for a person to believe in God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>150-152&nbsp;<br>
  176-178</p>
  <p>It means to adhere to God himself, entrusting oneself to him and giving assent 
to all the truths which God has revealed because God is Truth. It means to 
believe in one God in three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>28. What are the characteristics of faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>153-165<o:p><BR></o:p>179-180<o:p><BR></o:p>183-184&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Faith is the supernatural virtue which is <i>necessary</i> for salvation. It is 
a <i>free gift</i> of God and is accessible to all who humbly seek it. The act 
of faith is <i>a human act</i>, that is, an act of the intellect of a person - 
prompted by the will moved by God - who freely assents to divine truth.  Faith is also <i>certain</i> because it is founded on the Word of God; it <i>
works</i> "through charity"<i> </i>(<i>Galatians</i> 5:6); and it <i>continually grows</i> 
through listening to the Word of God and through prayer. It is, even now, a <i>
foretaste</i> of the joys of heaven.</p>
  <p><b>29. Why is there no contradiction between faith and science?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>159&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Though faith is above reason, there can never be a contradiction between faith 
and science because both originate in God. It is God himself who gives to us the 
light both of reason and of faith. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"I believe, in order to understand; and I understand, the better to 
believe."</i> (Saint Augustine)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300">We Believe</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>30. Why is faith a personal act, and at the same time ecclesial?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>166-169<o:p><BR></o:p>181<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Faith is a personal act insofar as it is the free response of the human person<i>
</i>to God who reveals himself. But at the same time it is an ecclesial act 
which expresses itself in the proclamation, "We believe".  It is in fact the Church that believes: and thus by the grace of the Holy Spirit 
precedes, engenders and nourishes the faith of each Christian&nbsp;For this reason the Church is Mother and Teacher.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"No one can have God as Father who does not have 
    the Church as<b>
</b>Mother." </i>(Saint Cyprian)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>31. Why are the formulas of faith important?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>170-171</p>
  <p>The formulas of faith are important because they permit one to express, 
assimilate, celebrate, and share together with others the truths of the faith 
through a common language.</p>
  <p><b>32. In what way is the faith of the Church one faith alone?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>172-175&nbsp;<br>
  182</p>
  <p>The Church, although made up of persons who have diverse languages, cultures, 
and rites, nonetheless professes with a united voice the one faith that was 
received from the one Lord and that was passed on by the one Apostolic 
Tradition. She confesses one God alone, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, and points 
to one way of salvation. Therefore we believe with one heart and one soul all 
that is contained in the Word of God, handed down<i> </i>or written, and which 
is proposed by the Church as divinely revealed.</p>

  <p><b>33. What are the symbols of faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>185-188&nbsp;<br>
  192, 197</p>
  <p>The symbols of faith are composite formulas, also called "professions of faith" 
or "Creeds", with which the Church from her very beginning has set forth 
synthetically and handed on her own faith in a language that is normative and 
common to all the faithful.</p>
  <p><b>34. What are the most ancient symbols (professions) of faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>189-191&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The most ancient symbols of faith are the <i>baptismal</i> creeds. Because 
Baptism is conferred "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy 
Spirit" (<i>Matthew</i> 28:19), the truths of faith professed at Baptism are 
articulated in reference to the three Persons of the Most Holy Trinity.</p>
  <p><b>35. What are the most important symbols of the faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>193-195&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They are the <i>Apostles&#39; Creed</i> which is the ancient baptismal symbol of the 
Church of Rome and the <i>Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed</i> which stems from<i>
</i>the first two ecumenical Councils, that of Nicea (325 A.D.) and that of 
Constantinople (381 A.D.) and which even to this day<i> </i>are common to all 
the great Churches of the East and the West.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300"><i>"I believe in God the Father Almighty,  <BR>Creator of 
  heaven and earth."</i></font></b></p>
  <p><b>36. Why does the Profession of Faith begin with the words, "I believe in God"?</b></p>
  <p>198-199</p>
  <p>The Profession of Faith begins with these words because the affirmation "I 
believe in God" is the most important, the source of all the other truths about 
man and about the world, and about the entire life of everyone who believes in 
God.</p>
  <p><b>37. Why does one profess belief that there is only one God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>200-202<br>
  228</p>
  <p>Belief in the one God is professed because he has revealed himself to the people 
of Israel as the only One when he said, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one 
Lord" (<i>Deuteronomy</i> 6:4) and "there is no other" (<i>Isaiah</i> 45:22). Jesus himself 
confirmed that God is "the one Lord" (<i>Mark</i>  12:29). To confess that Jesus and the Holy Spirit are also God and Lord does not 
introduce any division into the one God.</p>
  <p><b>38. With what name does God reveal Himself?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>203-209&nbsp;<br>
  230-231</p>
  <p>God revealed himself to Moses as the living God, "the God of Abraham, the God of 
Isaac, the God of Jacob" (<i>Exodus</i> 3:6). God also revealed to Moses his mysterious 
name "I Am Who I Am (YHWH)". Already in Old Testament times this ineffable name 
of God was replaced by the divine title <i>Lord</i>.  Thus in the New Testament, Jesus who was called <i>Lord</i> is seen as true God.</p>
  <p><b>39. Is God the only One who "is"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2112-213&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since creatures have received everything they are and have from God, only God in 
himself <i>is</i> the fullness of being and of every perfection. God is "He who 
is"<i> </i>without origin and without end. Jesus also reveals that he bears the 
divine name "I Am" (<i>John</i>  8:28).</p>
  <p><b>40. Why is the revelation of God&#39;s name important?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>206-213</p>
  <p>In revealing his name, God makes known the riches contained in the ineffable 
mystery of his being. He alone is from everlasting to everlasting. He is the One 
who transcends the world and history. It is he who made heaven and earth. He is 
the faithful God, always close to his people, in order to save them. He is the 
highest holiness, "rich in mercy" (<i>Ephesians</i> 2:4), always ready to forgive. He 
is the One who is spiritual, transcendent, omnipotent, eternal, personal, and 
perfect. He is truth and love.</p>

  <p><b>41. In what way is God the truth?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>214-217&nbsp;<br>
  231</p>
  <p>God is Truth itself and as such he can neither deceive nor be deceived. He is 
"light, and in him there is no darkness" (1 <i>John</i> 1:5). The eternal Son of God, 
the incarnation of wisdom, was sent into the world "to bear witness to the 
Truth" (<i>John</i> 18:37).</p>
  <p><b>42. In what way does God reveal that he is love?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>218-221</p>
  <p>God revealed himself to Israel as the One who has a stronger love than that of 
parents for their children or of husbands and wives for their spouses. God in 
himself "is love" (<i>1 John </i>4: 8.16), who gives himself completely and 
gratuitously, who "so loved the world that he gave his only Son so that the 
world might be saved through him" (<i>John</i> 3:16-17). By sending his Son and the 
Holy Spirit, God reveals that he himself is an eternal exchange of love.</p>
  <p><b>43. What does it mean to believe in only one God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>222-227&nbsp;<br>
  229</p>
  <p>To believe in the one and only God involves coming to know<i> </i>his greatness 
and majesty. It involves living in thanksgiving and trusting always in him, even 
in adversity. It involves knowing the unity and true dignity of all human 
beings, created in his image. It involves making good use of<i> </i>the things 
which he has created.</p>
  <p><b>44. What is the central mystery of Christian<i> </i>faith and life?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>232-237&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The central mystery of Christian faith and life is the mystery of the Most 
Blessed Trinity. Christians are baptized in the name of the Father and of the 
Son and of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>45. Can the mystery of the Most Holy Trinity be known by the light of human 
reason alone?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>237&nbsp;</p>
  <p>God has left some traces of his trinitarian being in creation and in the Old 
Testament but his inmost being as the Holy Trinity is a mystery which is 
inaccessible to reason alone or even to Israel"s faith before the Incarnation of 
the Son of God and the sending of the Holy Spirit. This mystery was revealed by 
Jesus Christ and it is the source of all the other mysteries.</p>
  <p><b>46. What did Jesus Christ reveal to us about the mystery of the Father?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>240-242&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Jesus Christ revealed to us that God is "Father", not only insofar as he created 
the universe and the mankind, but above all because he eternally generated in 
his bosom the Son who is his Word, " the radiance of the glory of God and the 
very stamp of his nature" (<i>Hebrews</i> 1:3).</p>
  <p><b>47. Who is the Holy Spirit revealed to us by Jesus Christ?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>243-248</p>
  <p>The Holy Spirit is the third Person of the Most Blessed Trinity. He is God, one 
and equal with the Father and the Son. He "proceeds from the Father" (<i>John</i> 
15:26) who is the principle without a principle and the origin of all trinitarian life. He proceeds also from the Son <i>(Filioque)</i> by the eternal 
Gift which the Father makes of him to the Son. Sent by the Father and the 
Incarnate Son, the Holy Spirit guides the Church "to know all truth" (<i>John</i> 
16:13).</p>
  <p><b>48. How does the Church express her trinitarian faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>249-256<o:p><BR></o:p>266</p>
  <p>The Church expresses her trinitarian faith by professing a belief in the oneness 
of God in whom there are three Persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three 
divine Persons are only one God because each of them equally possesses the 
fullness of the one and indivisible divine nature. They are really distinct from 
each other by reason of the relations which place them in correspondence to each 
other. The Father generates the Son; the Son is generated by the Father; the 
Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son.</p>
  <p><b>49. How do the three divine Persons work?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>257-260<br>
  267</p>
  <p>Inseparable in their one substance, the three divine Persons are also 
inseparable in their activity. The Trinity has one operation, sole and the same. 
In this one divine action, however, each Person is present according to the mode 
which is proper to him in the Trinity.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"O my God, Trinity whom I adore...grant my soul 
    peace; make it your heaven, your beloved dwelling, and the place of your 
    rest. May I never abandon you there, but may I be there, whole and entire, 
    completely vigilant in my faith, entirely adoring, and wholly given over to 
    your creative action."</i> (Blessed Elizabeth of the Trinity)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>50. What does it mean to say that God is almighty?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>268-278<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>God reveals himself as "the strong One, the mighty One" (<i>Psalm</i> 24:8), as the One 
"to whom nothing is impossible" (<i>Luke</i> 1:37). His omnipotence is universal, 
mysterious and shows itself in the creation of the world out of nothing and 
humanity out of love; but above all it shows itself in the Incarnation and the 
Resurrection of his Son, in the gift of filial adoption and in the forgiveness 
of sins. For this reason, the Church directs her prayers to the "almighty and 
eternal God" <i>("Omnipotens sempiterne Deus...")</i>.</p>
  <p><b>51. What is the importance of affirming "In the beginning God created the 
heavens and the earth" (<i>Genesis</i> 1:1)?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>279-289&nbsp;<br>
  315</p>
  <p>The significance is that creation is the foundation of all God"s saving plans. 
It shows forth the almighty and wise love<i> </i>of God, and it is the first 
step toward the covenant of the one God with his people. It is the beginning of 
the history of salvation which culminates in Christ; and it is the first answer 
to our fundamental questions regarding our very origin and destiny.</p>
  <p><b>52. Who created the world?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>290-292<o:p><br>
  316</o:p></p>
  <p>The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are the one and indivisible principle 
of creation even though the work of creating the world is particularly 
attributed to God the Father.</p>
  <p><b>53. Why was the world created?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>293-294<br>
  319</p>
  <p>The world was created for the glory of God who wished to show forth and 
communicate his goodness, truth and beauty. The ultimate end of creation is that 
God, in Christ, might be "all in all" (<i>1</i> <i>Corinthians</i> 15:28) for his glory and 
for our happiness.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"The glory of God is man fully alive; moreover man"s life is the 
vision of God." </i>(Saint Irenaeus)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>54. How did God create the universe?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>295-301<br>
  317-320</p>
  <p>God created the universe freely with wisdom and love. The world is not the 
result of any necessity, nor of blind fate, nor of chance. God created "out of 
nothing" (<i>ex nihilo</i>)<i> </i>(2 <i>Maccabees</i> 7:28) a world which is ordered and good and which he infinitely 
transcends. God preserves his creation in being and sustains it, giving it the 
capacity<i> </i>to act and leading it toward its fulfillment through his Son and 
the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>55. What is divine providence?</b></p>
  <p>302-306<br>
  321</p>
  <p>Divine Providence consists in the dispositions with which God leads his 
creatures toward their ultimate end. God is the sovereign Master of his own 
plan. To carry it out, however, he also makes use of the cooperation of his 
creatures. For God grants his creatures the dignity of acting on their own and 
of being causes for each other.</p>
  <p><b>56. How do we collaborate with divine Providence?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>307-308<br>
  323</p>
  <p>While respecting our freedom, God asks us to cooperate with him and gives us the 
ability to do so through actions, prayers and sufferings, thus awakening in us 
the desire "to will and to work for his good pleasure" (<i>Philippians</i> 2:13).</p>
  <p><b>57. If God is omnipotent and provident, why then does evil exist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>309-310<br>
  324, 400</p>
  <p>To this question, as painful and mysterious as it is, only the <i>whole</i> of 
Christian faith can constitute a response. God is not in any way - directly or 
indirectly - the cause of evil. He illuminates the mystery of evil in his Son 
Jesus Christ who died and rose in order to vanquish that great moral evil, human 
sin, which is at the root of all other evils.</p>
  <p><b>58. Why does God permit evil?</b></p>
  <p>311-314<BR>324&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Faith gives us the certainty that God would not permit evil if he did not cause 
a good to come from that very evil. This was realized in a wondrous way by God 
in the death and resurrection of Christ. In fact, from the greatest of all moral 
evils (the murder of his Son) he has brought forth the greatest of all goods 
(the glorification of Christ and our redemption).</p>

Earth</b></i></font></p>
  <p><b>59. What did God create?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>325-327</p>
  <p>Sacred Scripture says, "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth" 
(<i>Genesis</i> 1:1). The Church in her profession of faith proclaims that God is the 
Creator of everything, visible and invisible, of all spiritual and corporeal 
beings, that is, of angels and of the visible world and, in a special way, of 
man.</p>
  <p><b>60. Who are the angels?</b></p>
  <p>328-333<br>
  350-351</p>
  <p>The angels are purely spiritual creatures, incorporeal, invisible, immortal, and 
personal beings endowed with intelligence and will. They ceaselessly contemplate 
God face-to-face and they glorify him. They serve him and are his messengers in 
the accomplishment of<i> </i>his saving mission to all.</p>
  <p><b>61. In what way are angels present in the life of the Church? </b></p>
  <p><b></b>334-336<br>
  352</p>
  <p>The Church joins with the angels in adoring God, invokes their assistance and 
commemorates some in her liturgy. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>" Beside each believer stands an angel as a protector and shepherd 
leading him to life." </i>(Saint Basil the Great)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>62. What does Sacred Scripture teach about the creation of the visible world?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>337-344</p>
  <p>Through the account of the "six days" of creation Sacred Scripture teaches us 
the value of the created world and its purpose, namely, to praise God and to 
serve humanity. Every single thing owes its very existence to God from whom it 
receives its goodness and perfection, its proper laws and its proper place in 
the universe.</p>
  <p><b>63. What is the place of the human person in creation?</b></p>
  <p>343-344<br>
  353</p>
  <p>The human person is the summit of visible creation in as much as he or she is 
created in the image and likeness of God.</p>
  <p><b>64. What kind of bond exists between created things?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>342<br>
  354</p>
  <p>There exist an interdependence and a hierarchy among creatures as willed by God. 
At the same time, there is also a unity and solidarity among creatures since all 
have the same Creator, are loved by him and are ordered to his glory. Respecting 
the laws inscribed in creation and the relations which derive from the nature of 
things is, therefore, a principle of wisdom and a foundation for morality.</p>
  <p><b>65. What is the relationship between the work of creation and the work of 
redemption?</b></p>
  <p>345-349</p>
  <p>The work of creation culminates in the still greater<i> </i>work of redemption, 
which in fact gives rise to a new creation in which everything will recover its 
true meaning and fulfillment.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#663300" size="4"><i> <b>Man</b></i></font></p>
  <p><b>66. In what sense do we understand man and woman as created "in the image of 
God"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>355-357&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The human person&nbsp;is created in the image of God in the sense that he or she is capable of 
knowing and of loving their Creator in freedom. Human beings are the only 
creatures on earth that God has willed for their own sake and has called to 
share, through knowledge and love, in his own divine life. All human beings, in 
as much as they are created in the image of God, have the dignity of a person. A 
person is not something but someone, capable of self-knowledge and of freely 
giving himself and entering into communion with God and with other persons. </p>
  <p><b>67. For what purpose did God create man and woman?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>358-359<o:p><BR></o:p>380-381<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>God has created everything for them; but he has created them to know, serve and 
love God, to offer all of creation in this world in thanksgiving back to him and 
to be raised up to life with him in heaven. Only in the mystery of the incarnate 
Word does the mystery of the human person come into true light. Man and woman 
are predestined to reproduce the image of the Son of God made Man, who is the 
perfect "image of the invisible God" (<i>Colossians</i> 1:15).</p>
  <p><b>68. Why does the human race form a unity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>360-361</p>
  <p>All people form the unity of the human race by reason of the common origin which 
they have from God. God has made "from one ancestor all the nations of men" 
(<i>Acts</i>  17:26). All have but one Savior and are called to share in the eternal happiness of 
God.</p>
  <p><b>69. How do the soul and body form a unity in the human being?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>362-365<br>
  382</p>
  <p>The human person is a being at once<i> </i>corporeal and spiritual. In man 
spirit and matter form one nature. This unity is so profound that, thanks to the 
spiritual principle which is the soul, the body which is material, becomes a 
living human body and participates in the dignity of the image of God.</p>
  <p><b>70. Where does the soul come from?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>366-368&nbsp;<br>
  382</p>
  <p>The spiritual soul does not come from one"s parents but is created immediately 
by God and is immortal. It does not perish at the moment when it is separated 
from the body in death and it will be once again reunited with the body at the 
moment of the final resurrection.</p>
  <p><b>71. What relationship has God established between man and woman?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>369-373<br>
  383</p>
  <p>Man and woman have been created by God in equal dignity insofar as they are 
human persons. At the same time, they have been created in a reciprocal 
complementarity insofar as they are masculine and feminine. God has willed them 
one <i>for</i> the other to form a communion of persons. They are also called to 
transmit human life by forming in matrimony "one flesh" (<i>Genesis</i> 2:24). They are 
likewise called to subdue the earth as "stewards" of God.</p>
  <p><b>72. What was the original condition of the human person according to the plan of 
God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>374-379<br>
  384</p>
  <p>In creating man and woman God had given them a special participation in his own 
divine life in holiness and justice. In the plan of God they would not have had 
to suffer or die. Furthermore, a perfect harmony held sway within the human 
person, a harmony between creature and Creator, between man and woman, as well 
as between the first human couple and all of creation.</p>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300"><font size="4">The Fall</font></font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>73. How should we understand the reality of sin?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>385-389</p>
  <p>Sin is present in human history. This reality of sin can be understood clearly 
only in the light of divine revelation and above all in the light of Christ the 
Savior of all. Where sin abounded, he made grace to abound all the more. </p>
  <p><b>74. What was the fall of the angels?</b></p>
  <p>391-395<br>
  414</p>
  <p>This expression indicates that Satan and the other demons, about which Sacred 
Scripture and the Tradition of the Church speak, were angels, created good by 
God. They were, however, transformed into evil because with a free and 
irrevocable choice they rejected God and his Kingdom, thus giving rise to the 
existence of hell. They try to associate human beings with their revolt against 
God. However, God has wrought in Christ a sure victory over the Evil One.</p>
  <p><b>75. What was the first human sin?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>396-403<br>
  415-417</p>
  <p>When tempted by the devil, the first man and woman allowed trust in their 
Creator to die in their hearts. In their disobedience they wished to become 
"like God" but without God and not in accordance with God (<i>Genesis</i> 3:5). Thus, 
Adam and Eve immediately lost for themselves and for all their descendants the 
original grace of holiness and justice.</p>
  <p><b>76. What is original sin?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>404<br>
  419</p>
  <p>Original sin, in which all human beings are born, is the state of deprivation of 
original holiness and<i> </i>justice. It is a sin "contracted" by us not 
"committed"; it is a state of birth and not a personal act. Because of the 
original unity of all human beings, it is transmitted to the descendants of Adam 
"not by imitation, but by propagation". This transmission remains a mystery 
which we cannot fully understand.</p>
  <p><b>77. What other consequences derive from original sin?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>405-409<br>
  418</p>
  <p>In consequence of original sin human nature<u>,</u> without being totally 
corrupted<u>,</u> is wounded in its natural powers. It is subject to ignorance, 
to suffering, and to the dominion of death and is inclined toward sin. This 
inclination is called <i>concupiscence</i>.</p>
  <p><b>78. After the first sin, what did God do?</b></p>
  <p>410-412<br>
  420</p>
  <p>After the first sin the world was inundated with sin but God did not abandon man 
to the power of death. Rather, he foretold in a mysterious way in the 
"Protoevangelium" (<i>Genesis</i> 3:15) that evil would be conquered and that man would 
be lifted up<i> </i>from his fall. This was the first proclamation of the 
Messiah and Redeemer. Therefore, the fall would be called in the future a "<i>happy 
fault</i>" because it "gained for us<i> </i>so great a Redeemer" (Liturgy of the 
Easter Vigil).</p>

  <p><b>79. What is the Good News for humanity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>422-424</p>
  <p>It is the proclamation of Jesus Christ, the "Son of the living<i> </i>God" 
(<i>Matthew</i> 16:16), who died and rose from the dead. In the time of King Herod and 
the Emperor Caesar Augustus, God fulfilled the promises that he made to Abraham 
and his descendants. He sent "his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to 
redeem those who were under the law<i>,</i> so that we might receive adoption as 
sons" (<i>Galatians</i> 4:4-5).</p>
  <p><b>80. How is the Good News spread?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>425-429&nbsp;</p>
  <p>From the very beginning the first disciples burned with the desire<i> </i>to 
proclaim Jesus Christ in order to lead all to faith in him. Even today, from the 
loving knowledge of Christ there springs up in the believer the desire<i> </i>to 
evangelize and catechize, that is, to reveal in the Person of Christ the entire 
design of God and to put humanity in communion with him. </p>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300">"And in Jesus Christ, His only Son our Lord"</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>81. What is the meaning of the name "Jesus"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>430-435<br>
  452</p>
  <p>Given by the angel at the time of the Annunciation, the name "Jesus" means "God 
saves". The name expresses his identity and his mission "because he will save 
his people from their sins" (<i>Matthew</i> 1:21). Peter proclaimed that "there is no 
other name under heaven given to men by which we can<i> </i>be saved" (<i>Acts</i> 
4:12).</p>
  <p><b>82. Why is Jesus called "Christ"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>436-440<o:p><BR></o:p>453<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>"Christ" in Greek, "Messiah" in Hebrew, means the "anointed one". Jesus is the 
Christ because he is consecrated by God and anointed by the Holy Spirit for his 
redeeming mission. He is the Messiah awaited by Israel, sent into the world by 
the Father. Jesus accepted the title of Messiah but he made the meaning of the 
term clear:<i> </i>"come<i> </i>down from heaven" (<i>John</i> 3:13), crucified and 
then risen , he is the Suffering Servant "who gives his life as a<i> </i>ransom 
for the many" (<i>Matthew</i> 20:28). From the name Christ comes our name of <i>
Christian</i>.</p>
  <p><b>83. In what sense is Jesus the Only Begotten Son of God?</b></p>
  <p>441-445<BR>454</p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>Jesus&nbsp;is the Son of God in a unique and perfect way. At the time of his Baptism 
and his Transfiguration, the voice of the Father designated Jesus as his 
"beloved Son". In presenting himself as the Son who "knows the Father" (<i>Matthew</i> 
11:27), Jesus affirmed his singular and eternal relationship with God his 
Father. He is "the Only Begotten Son of God" (<i>1 John</i> 4:9), the second Person of 
the Blessed Trinity. He is the central figure of apostolic preaching. The 
apostles saw "his glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father" (<i>John</i> 1:14).</p>
  <p><b>84. What is the meaning of the title "Lord"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>446-451&nbsp;<br>
  455</p>
  <p>In the Bible this title regularly designates God as Sovereign. Jesus ascribed 
this title to himself and revealed his divine sovereignty by his power over 
nature, over demons, over sin, and over death, above all by his own 
Resurrection. The first Christian creeds proclaimed that the power, the honor, 
and the glory that are due to God the Father also belong to Jesus: God "has 
given him the name which is above every other name" (<i>Philippians</i> 2:9). He is the 
Lord of the world and of history, the only One to whom we must completely submit 
our personal freedom. </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>85. Why did the Son of God become man?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>456-460&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For us men and for our salvation, the Son of God became incarnate in the womb of 
the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit. He did so to reconcile us 
sinners with God, to have us learn of God"s infinite love, to be our model of 
holiness and to make us "partakers of the divine nature" (<i>2 Peter </i>1:4).</p>
  <p><b>86. What does the word "Incarnation" mean?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>461-463<br>
  483</p>
  <p>The Church calls the mystery of the wonderful union of the divine and human 
natures<i> </i>in the one divine Person of the Word the "Incarnation". To bring 
about our salvation the Son of God was made "flesh" (<i>John</i> 1:14) and became truly 
man. Faith in the Incarnation is a distinctive sign of the Christian faith.</p>
  <p><b>87. In what way is Jesus Christ true God and true man?</b></p>
  <p>464-467<BR>469</p>
  <p>Jesus is inseparably true God and true man in the unity of his divine Person. As 
the Son of God, who is "begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father," he 
was made true man, our brother, without ceasing to be God, our Lord.</p>
  <p><b>88. What does the Council of Chalcedon (in the year 451) teach in this regard?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>467</p>
  <p>The Council of Chalcedon teaches us to confess "one and the same Son, our Lord 
Jesus Christ, perfect in his humanity, true God and true man, composed of 
rational soul and body, consubstantial with the Father by his divinity, and 
consubstantial with us by his humanity, "like us in all things but sin" (<i>Hebrews</i> 
4:15), begotten from the Father before all ages as to his divinity, and in these 
last days, for us and for our salvation, born of Mary, the Virgin and Mother of 
God, as to his humanity." </p>
  <p><b>89. How does the Church set forth the Mystery of the Incarnation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>464-470<br>
  479-481</p>
  <p>The Church confesses that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, with two 
natures, a divine nature and a human nature, not confused with each other but 
united in the Person of the Word. Therefore, in the humanity of Jesus all things 
- his miracles, his suffering, and his death - must be attributed to his divine 
Person which acts by means of his assumed human nature.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"O Only-begotten Son and Word of God you who are immortal, you who deigned for 
our salvation to become incarnate of the holy Mother of God and ever Virgin Mary 
(...) You who are one of the Holy Trinity, glorified with the Father and the 
Holy Spirit, save us!"</i> (Byzantine Liturgy of Saint John Chrysostom)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>90. Did the incarnate Son of God have a soul with human knowledge?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>470-474<br>
  482</p>
  <p>The Son of God assumed a body animated by a rational human soul. With his human 
intellect Jesus learned many things by way of experience; but also as man the 
Son of God had an intimate<i> </i>and immediate knowledge of God his Father. He 
likewise understood people"s secret thoughts and he knew fully the eternal plans 
which he had come to reveal.</p>
  <p><b>91. How did the two wills of the incarnate Word cooperate?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>475&nbsp;<br>
  482</p>
  <p>Jesus had a divine will and a human will. In his earthly life the Son of God 
humanly willed all that he had divinely decided with the Father and the Holy 
Spirit for our salvation. The human will of Christ followed without opposition 
or reluctance the divine will or, in other words, it was subject to it. </p>
  <p><b>92. Did Christ have a true human body?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>476-477</p>
  <p>Christ assumed a true human body by means of which the invisible God became 
visible. This is the reason why Christ can be represented and venerated in 
sacred images.</p>
  <p><b>93. What does the heart of Jesus exemplify?</b></p>
  <p>478</p>
  <p>Jesus knew us and loved us with a human heart. His Heart, pierced for our 
salvation, is the symbol of that infinite love with which he loves the Father 
and each one of us. </p>
  <p><b>94. What is the meaning of the expression "conceived by the power of the Holy 
Spirit..."?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>484-486</p>
  <p>This expression means that the Virgin Mary conceived the eternal Son in her womb 
by the power of the Holy Spirit without the cooperation of a man. The angel told 
her at the Annunciation that "the Holy Spirit will come upon you" (<i>Luke</i> 1:35).</p>
  <p><b>95. "...Born of the Virgin Mary": Why is Mary truly the Mother of God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>495<br>
  509</p>
  <p>Mary is truly the <i>Mother of God</i> because she is the Mother of Jesus (<i>John</i> 
2:1, <i>John</i> 19:25). The One who was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and 
became truly her Son is actually the eternal Son of God the Father. He is God 
himself. </p>
  <p><b>96. What does the "Immaculate Conception" mean?</b></p>
  <p>487-492<BR>508&nbsp;</p>
  <p>God freely chose Mary from all eternity to be the Mother of his Son. In order to 
carry out her mission she herself was <i>conceived immaculate</i>. This means 
that, thanks to the grace of God and in anticipation of the merits of Jesus 
Christ, Mary was preserved from original sin from the first instant<i> </i>of 
her conception.</p>
  <p><b>97. How does Mary cooperate in the divine plan of salvation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>493-494<br>
  508-511</p>
  <p>By the grace of God Mary was kept free from every personal sin her whole life 
long. She is the one who is "full of grace" (<i>Luke</i> 1:28), "the all holy". When 
the angel announced to her that she would give birth to "the Son of the Most 
High" (<i>Luke</i> 1:32), she freely gave her consent with "the obedience of faith" 
(<i>Romans</i> 1:5). Mary thus gave herself entirely to the person and work of her Son 
Jesus, espousing wholeheartedly<i> </i>the divine will regarding salvation.</p>
  <p><b>98. What does the virginal conception of Jesus mean?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>496-498<br>
  503</p>
  <p>The virginal conception of Jesus means that Jesus was conceived in the womb of 
the Virgin solely by the power of the Holy Spirit without the intervention of a 
man. He is the Son of the heavenly Father according to his divine nature and the 
Son of Mary according to his human nature. He is, however, truly the Son of God 
in both natures since there is in him only one Person who is divine.</p>
  <p><b>99. In what sense is Mary "ever Virgin"?</b></p>
  <p>499-507<br>
  510-511</p>
  <p>Mary is ever virgin in the sense that she "remained a virgin in conceiving her 
Son, a virgin in giving birth to him, a virgin in carrying him, a virgin in 
nursing him at her breast, always a virgin" (Saint Augustine). Therefore, when 
the Gospels speak of the "brothers and sisters of Jesus", they are talking about 
the close relations of Jesus, according to the way of speaking used in Sacred 
Scripture. </p>
  <p><b>100. In what way is the spiritual motherhood of Mary universal?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>501-507<br>
  511</p>
  <p>Mary had only one Son, Jesus, but in him her spiritual motherhood extends to all 
whom he came to save. Obediently standing at the side of the new Adam, Jesus 
Christ, the Virgin is the <i>new Eve</i>, the true mother of all the living, who 
with a mother&#39;s love cooperates in their birth and their formation in the order 
of grace. Virgin and Mother, Mary is the figure of the Church, its most perfect 
realization.</p>
  <p><b>101. In what sense is the life of Christ a Mystery?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>512-521<br>
  561-562</p>
  <p>The entire life of Christ is a revelation. What was visible in the earthly life 
of Jesus leads us to the <i>invisible mystery of his divine sonship</i>: 
"whoever has seen me has seen<i> </i>the Father" (<i>John</i> 14:9). Furthermore, even 
though salvation comes completely from the cross and the resurrection, the 
entire life of Christ is a <i>mystery of redemption</i> because everything that 
Jesus did, said, and suffered had for its aim the salvation of fallen human 
beings and the restoration of their vocation as children of God. </p>
  <p><b>102.  How did God prepare the world for the mystery of Christ?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>522-524</p>
  <p>God prepared for the coming of his Son over the centuries. He awakened in the 
hearts of the pagans a dim expectation of this coming and he prepared for it 
specifically through the Old Testament, culminating with <i>John the Baptist</i> 
who was the last and greatest of the prophets. We relive this long period of 
expectancy in the annual liturgical celebration of the season of Advent.</p>
  <p><b>103. What does the Gospel teach about the mysteries of the birth and infancy of 
Jesus?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>525-530<br>
  563-564</p>
  <p>At <i>Christmas</i> the glory of heaven is shown forth in the weakness of a 
baby; the <i>circumcision </i>of Jesus is a sign of his belonging to<i> </i>the 
Hebrew people and is a prefiguration of our Baptism; the <i>Epiphany</i> is the 
manifestation of the Messiah King of Israel to all the nations; at the <i>
presentation in the temple,</i> Simeon and Anna symbolise all the anticipation 
of Israel awaiting its encounter with its Savior;<i> </i>the <i>flight into 
Egypt</i> and the massacre of the innocents proclaim<i> </i>that the entire life 
of Christ will be under the sign of persecution; the <i>departure from Egypt</i> 
recalls the exodus and presents Jesus as the new Moses and the true and 
definitive liberator.</p>
  <p><b>104. What does the hidden life of Jesus in Nazareth teach us?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>533-534<br>
  564</p>
  <p>In the course of his <i>hidden life</i> in Nazareth Jesus stayed in the silence 
of an ordinary existence. This allows us to enter into fellowship with<i> </i>
him in the holiness to be found in a daily life marked by prayer, simplicity, 
work and family love. His obedience to Mary and to Joseph, his foster father, is 
an image of his filial obedience to the Father. Mary and Joseph accepted with 
faith the mystery of Jesus even though they did not always understand it. </p>
  <p><b>105. Why did Jesus receive from John the "baptism of repentance for the 
forgiveness of sins" (<i>Luke</i> 3:3)?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>535-537<br>
  565</p>
  <p>To inaugurate his public life and to anticipate the "Baptism" of his death, he 
who was without sin accepted to be numbered among sinners. He was "the Lamb of 
God who takes away the sin of the world" (<i>John</i> 1:29). The Father proclaimed him 
to be "his beloved Son" (<i>Matthew</i> 3:17) and the Spirit descended upon him. The 
baptism of Jesus is a prefiguring of our baptism.</p>
  <p><b>106. What do we learn from the temptations of Jesus in the desert?</b></p>
  <p>538-540&nbsp;<br>
  566</p>
  <p>The temptations of Jesus in the desert recapitulate the temptation of Adam in 
Paradise and the temptations of Israel in the desert. Satan tempts Jesus in 
regard to his obedience to the mission given him by the Father. Christ, the new 
Adam, resists and his victory proclaims that of his passion which is the supreme 
obedience of his filial love. The Church unites herself to this mystery in a 
special way in the liturgical season of <i>Lent</i>.</p>
  <p><b>107. Who is invited to come into the Kingdom of God proclaimed and 
  brought about by Jesus?</b></p>
  <p>541-546<br>
  567</p>
  <p>All are invited by Jesus to enter the Kingdom of God. Even the worst of sinners 
is called to convert and to accept the boundless mercy of the Father. Already 
here on earth, the Kingdom belongs to those who accept it with a humble heart. 
To them the mysteries of the Kingdom are revealed.</p>
  <p><b>108. Why did Jesus manifest the Kingdom by means of signs and miracles?</b></p>
  <p>547-550<br>
  567</p>
  <p>Jesus accompanied his words with <i>signs</i> and <i>miracles</i> to bear 
witness to the fact that the Kingdom is present in him, the Messiah. Although he 
healed some people, he did not come to abolish all evils here below but rather 
to free us especially from the slavery of sin. The driving out of demons 
proclaimed that his cross would be victorious over "the ruler<i> </i>of this 
world" (<i>John</i> 12:31).</p>
  <p><b>109. In the Kingdom, what authority did Jesus bestow upon his Apostles?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>551-553&nbsp;<br>
  567</p>
  <p>Jesus chose the <i>twelve</i>, the future witnesses of his Resurrection, and 
made them sharers of his mission and of his authority to teach, to absolve from 
sins, and to build up and govern the Church. In this college, Peter received 
"the keys of the Kingdom" (<i>Matthew</i> 16:19) and assumed the first place with the 
mission to keep the faith in its integrity and to strengthen his brothers.</p>
  <p><b>110. What is the meaning of the Transfiguration?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>554-556&nbsp;<br>
  568</p>
  <p>Above all the Transfiguration shows forth the Trinity: "the Father in the voice, 
the Son in the man Jesus, the Spirit in the shining cloud" (Saint Thomas 
Aquinas). Speaking with Moses and Elijah about his "departure" (<i>Luke</i> 9:31), 
Jesus reveals that his glory comes by way of the cross and he anticipates his 
resurrection and his glorious coming "which will change our lowly body to be 
like his glorious body" (<i>Philippians</i> 3:21).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"You were transfigured on the mountain and your disciples, as much 
as they were capable of it, beheld your glory, O Christ our God, so that when 
they should see you crucified they would understand that your passion was 
voluntary, and proclaim to the world that you truly are the splendor of the 
    Father." </i>(Byzantine Liturgy)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>111. How did the messianic entrance into Jerusalem come about?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>557-560&nbsp;<br>
  569-570</p>
  <p>At the established time Jesus chose to go up to Jerusalem to suffer his passion 
and death, and to rise from the dead. As the Messiah King who shows forth the 
coming of the Kingdom, he entered into his city mounted on a donkey. He was 
acclaimed by the little children whose shout of joyful praise is taken up in the
<i>Sanctus</i> of the Eucharistic liturgy: "Blessed is He Who comes in the name 
of the Lord! <i>Hosanna</i> (save us!)" (<i>Matthew</i> 21:9). The liturgy of the 
Church opens<i> </i>Holy Week by celebrating this entry into Jerusalem. </p>
  <p align="center"><i><b><font color="#663300">"Jesus Christ suffered under Pontius Pilate  <BR>was crucified, died, and was buried."</font></b></i></p>
  <p><b>112. What is the importance of the Paschal Mystery of Jesus?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>571-573</p>
  <p>The Paschal Mystery of Jesus, which comprises his passion, death, resurrection, 
and glorification, stands at the center of the Christian faith because God&#39;s 
saving plan was accomplished once for all by the redemptive death of his Son 
Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p><b>113. What were the accusations by which Jesus was condemned to death?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>574-576</p>
  <p>Some of the leaders of Israel accused Jesus of acting against the law, the 
temple in Jerusalem, and in particular against faith in the one God because he 
proclaimed himself to be the Son of God. For this reason they handed him over to 
Pilate so that he might condemn him to death.</p>
  <p><b>114. How did Jesus conduct himself in regard to the Law of Israel?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>577-582<br>
  592</p>
  <p>Jesus did not abolish the Law given by God to Moses on Mount Sinai but he 
fulfilled it by giving it its definitive interpretation. He himself was the 
divine Legislator who fully carried out this Law. Furthermore, as the faithful 
Servant, he offered by means of his expiatory death the only sacrifice capable 
of making atonement for all the "transgressions committed by men under the first 
Covenant" (<i>Hebrews</i> 9:15).</p>
  <p><b>115. What was the attitude of Jesus toward the temple in  Jerusalem?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>583-586&nbsp;<br>
  593</p>
  <p>Jesus was accused of hostility to the temple. On the contrary, he venerated it 
as "the house of his Father" (<i>John</i> 2:16); and it was there that he imparted an 
important part of his teaching. However, he also foretold its destruction in 
connection with his own death and he presented himself as the definitive 
dwelling place of God among men.</p>
  <p><b>116. Did Jesus contradict Israel&#39;s faith in the one God and savior?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>587-591<br>
  594</p>
  <p>Jesus never contradicted faith in the one God, not even when he performed the 
stupendous divine work which fulfilled the messianic promises and revealed 
himself as equal to God, namely the pardoning of sins. However, the call of 
Jesus to believe in him and to be converted makes it possible to understand the 
tragic misunderstanding of the Sanhedrin which judged Jesus to be worthy of 
death as a blasphemer.</p>
  <p><b>117. Who is responsible for the death of Jesus?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>595-598&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The passion and death of Jesus cannot be imputed indiscriminately either to all 
the Jews that were living at that time or to their descendants. Every single 
sinner, that is, every human being is really the cause and the instrument of the 
sufferings of the Redeemer; and the greater blame in this respect falls on those 
above all who are Christians and who the more often fall into sin or delight in 
their vices. </p>
  <p><b>118. Why was the death of Jesus part of God&#39;s plan?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>599-605<br>
  619</p>
  <p>To reconcile to himself all who were destined to die because of sin God took the 
loving initiative of sending his Son that he might give himself up for sinners. 
Proclaimed in the Old Testament, especially as the sacrifice of the Suffering 
Servant, the death of Jesus came about "in accordance with the Scriptures". </p>
  <p><b>119. In what way did Christ offer himself to the Father?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>606-609<br>
  620</p>
  <p>The entire life of Christ was a free offering to the Father to carry out his 
plan of salvation. He gave "his life as a ransom for many" (<i>Mark</i> 10:45) and in 
this way he reconciled all of humanity with God. His suffering and death showed 
how his humanity was the free and perfect instrument of that divine love which 
desires the salvation of all people.</p>
  <p><b>120. How is Jesus" offering expressed at the Last Supper?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>610-611<br>
  621</p>
  <p>At the Last Supper with his apostles on the eve of his passion Jesus 
anticipated, that is, both symbolized his free self-offering and made it really 
present: "This is my Body which <i>is given</i> for you" (<i>Luke</i> 22:19), "This is 
my Blood which <i>is poured out</i>..." (<i>Matthew</i> 26:28) Thus he both instituted 
the Eucharist as the "memorial" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 11:25) of his sacrifice and 
instituted his apostles as priests of the new covenant. </p>
  <p><b>121. What happened in the Agony in the Garden of Gethsemane?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>612</p>
  <p>Despite the horror which death represented for the sacred humanity of Jesus "who 
is the Author of Life" (<i>Acts</i> 3:15), the human will of the Son of God remained 
faithful to the will of the Father for our salvation. Jesus accepted the duty to 
carry our sins in his Body "becoming obedient unto death" (<i>Philippians</i> 2:8).</p>
  <p><b>122. What are the results of the sacrifice of Christ on the cross?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>613-617<br>
  622-623</p>
  <p>Jesus freely offered his life as an expiatory sacrifice, that is, he made 
reparation for our sins with the full obedience of his love unto death. This 
love "to the end" (<i>John</i> 13:1) of the Son of God reconciled all of humanity with 
the Father. The paschal sacrifice of Christ, therefore, redeems humanity in a 
way that is unique, perfect, and definitive; and it opens up for them communion 
with God.</p>
  <p><b>123. Why does Jesus call upon his disciples to take up their cross?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>618</p>
  <p>By calling his disciples to take up their cross and follow him Jesus desires to 
associate with his redeeming sacrifice those who are to be its first 
beneficiaries.</p>
  <p><b>124. In what condition was the body of Christ while it lay in the tomb?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>624-630</p>
  <p>Christ underwent a real death and a true burial. However, the power of God 
preserved his body from corruption. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><i><font color="#663300">"Jesus Christ descended into hell;<BR>on the third day He rose again from the dead."</font></i></b></p>
  <p><b>125. What is the "hell" into which Jesus descended?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>632-637</p>
  <p>This "hell" was different from the <i>hell</i> of the damned. It was the state 
of all those, righteous and evil, who died before Christ. With his soul united 
to his divine Person Jesus went down to the just in hell who were awaiting their 
Redeemer so they could enter at last into the vision of God. When he had 
conquered by his death both death and the devil "who has the power of death" 
(<i>Hebrews</i> 2:14), he freed the just who looked forward to the Redeemer and opened 
for them the gates of heaven.</p>
  <p><b>126. What place does the Resurrection of Christ occupy in our faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>631, 638</p>
  <p>The Resurrection of Jesus is the crowning truth of our faith in Christ and 
represents along with his cross an essential part of the Paschal Mystery.</p>
  <p><b>127. What are the signs that bear witness to the Resurrection of Jesus?</b></p>
  <p>639-644&nbsp;<br>
  656-657</p>
  <p>Along with the essential sign of the empty tomb, the Resurrection of Jesus is 
witnessed to by the women who first encountered Christ and proclaimed him to the 
apostles. Jesus then "appeared to Cephas (Peter) and then to the Twelve. 
Following that he appeared to more than five hundred of the brethren at one 
time" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 15:5-6) and to others as well. The apostles could not have 
invented the story of the resurrection since it seemed impossible to them. As a 
matter of fact, Jesus himself upbraided them for their unbelief.</p>
  <p><b>128. Why is the Resurrection at the same time a transcendent occurrence?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>647<br>
  656-657</p>
  <p>While being an historical event, verifiable and attested by signs and 
testimonies, the Resurrection, insofar as it is the entrance of Christ&#39;s 
humanity into the glory of God, transcends and surpasses history as a mystery of 
faith. For this reason the risen Christ did not manifest himself to the world 
but to his disciples, making them his witnesses to the people.</p>
  <p><b>129. What is the condition of the risen body of Jesus?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>645-646</p>
  <p>The Resurrection of Christ was not a return to earthly life. His risen body is 
that which was crucified and bears the marks of his passion. However it also 
participates in the divine life, with the characteristics of a glorified body. 
Because of this the risen Jesus was utterly free to appear to his disciples how 
and where he wished and under various aspects.</p>
  <p><b>130. How is the Resurrection the work of the Most Holy Trinity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>648-650</p>
  <p>The Resurrection of Christ is a transcendent work of God. The three Persons act 
together according to what is proper to them: the Father manifests his power; 
the Son "takes again" the life which he freely offered (<i>John</i> 10:17), reuniting 
his soul and his body which the Spirit brings to life and glorifies.</p>
  <p><b>131. What is the saving meaning of the Resurrection?</b></p>
  <p>651-655<BR>658</p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>The Resurrection is the climax of the Incarnation. It confirms the divinity of 
Christ and all the things which he did and taught. It fulfills all the divine 
promises made for us. Furthermore the risen Christ, the conqueror of sin and 
death, is the principle of our justification and our Resurrection. It procures 
for us now the grace of filial adoption which is a real share in the life of the 
only begotten Son. At the end of time he will raise up our bodies.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><i><font color="#663300">"Jesus Ascended into Heaven<BR>and Is Seated at the Right Hand of<BR>God the Father Almighty"</font></i></b></p>
  <p><b>132. What does the Ascension mean?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>659-667</p>
  <p>After forty days during which Jesus showed himself to the apostles with ordinary 
human features which veiled his glory as the Risen One, Christ ascended into 
heaven and was seated at the right hand of the Father. He is the Lord who now in 
his humanity reigns in the everlasting glory of the Son of God and constantly 
intercedes for us before the Father. He sends us his Spirit and he gives us the 
hope of one day reaching the place he has prepared for us. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><i><font color="#663300">"From thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead"</font></i></b></p>
  <p><b>133. How does the Lord Jesus now reign?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>668-674<br>
  680</p>
  <p>As the Lord of the cosmos and of history, the Head of his Church, the glorified 
Christ mysteriously remains on earth where his kingdom is already present in 
seed and in its beginning in the Church. One day he will return in glory but we 
do not know the time. Because of this we live in watchful anticipation, praying 
"Come, Lord" (<i>Revelation</i> 22:20).</p>
  <p><b>134. How will the coming of the Lord in glory happen?</b></p>
  <p>675-677<br>
  680</p>
  <p>After the final cosmic upheaval of this passing world the glorious coming of 
Christ will take place. Then will come the definitive triumph of God in the 
parousia and the Last Judgment. Thus the Kingdom of God will be realized.</p>
  <p><b>135. How will Christ judge the living and the dead?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>678-679<br>
  681-682</p>
  <p>Christ will judge with the power he has gained as the Redeemer of the world who 
came to bring salvation to all. The secrets of hearts will be brought to light 
as well as the conduct of each one toward God and toward his neighbor. Everyone, 
according to how he has lived, will either be filled with life or damned for 
eternity. In this way, "the fullness of Christ" (<i>Ephesians</i> 4:13) will come about 
in which "God will be all in all" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 15:28).</p>

  <p><b>136. What does the Church mean when she confesses: "I believe in the Holy 
Spirit"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>683-686&nbsp;</p>
  <p>To believe in the Holy Spirit is to profess faith in the Third Person of the 
Most Holy Trinity who proceeds from the Father and the Son and "is worshipped 
and glorified with the Father and the Son". The Spirit is "sent into our hearts" 
(<i>Galatians</i> 4:6) so that we might receive new life as sons of God.</p>
  <p><b>137. Why are the missions of the Son and the Holy Spirit inseparable?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>687-690<br>
  742-743</p>
  <p>In the indivisible Trinity, the Son and the Spirit are distinct but inseparable. 
From the very beginning until the end of time, when the Father sends his Son he 
also sends his Spirit who unites us to Christ in faith so that as adopted sons 
we can call God "Father" (<i>Romans</i> 8:15). The Spirit is invisible but we know him 
through his actions, when he reveals the Word to us and when he acts in the 
Church.</p>
  <p><b>138. What are the names of the Holy Spirit?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>691-693</p>
  <p>"The Holy Spirit" is the proper name of the third Person of the Most Holy 
Trinity. Jesus also called him the Paraclete (Consoler or Advocate) and the 
Spirit of Truth. The New Testament also refers to him as the Spirit of Christ, 
of the Lord, of God - the Spirit of Glory and the Spirit of the Promise.</p>
  <p><b>139. What symbols are used to represent the Holy Spirit?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>694-701</p>
  <p>There are many symbols of the Holy Spirit: <i>living water</i> which springs 
from the wounded Heart of Christ and which quenches the thirst of the baptized;
<i>anointing </i>with oil, which is the sacramental sign of Confirmation; <i>
fire</i> which transforms what it touches; the <i>cloud,</i> dark or luminous, 
in which the divine glory is revealed; the <i>imposition of hands</i> by which 
the Holy Spirit is given; the <i>dove</i> which descended on Christ at his 
baptism and remained with him.</p>
  <p><b>140. What does it mean that the Spirit "has spoken through the prophets"?</b></p>
  <p>687-688<BR>702-716<u><o:p><BR></o:p></u>743</p>
  <p>The term "<i>prophets</i>" means those who were inspired by the Holy Spirit to 
speak in the name of God. The Spirit brings the prophecies of the Old Testament 
to their complete fulfillment in Christ whose mystery he reveals in the New 
Testament.</p>
  <p><b>141. What did the Holy Spirit accomplish in John the Baptist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>717-720</p>
  <p>The Spirit filled John the Baptist, who was the last prophet of the Old 
Testament. Under his inspiration John was sent to "prepare for the Lord a people 
well disposed" (<i>Luke</i> 1:17). He was to proclaim the coming of Christ, the Son of 
God, upon whom he saw the Spirit descend and remain, the one who "baptizes with 
the Spirit" (<i>John</i> 1:33).</p>
  <p><b>142. What is the work of the Spirit in Mary?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>721-726<br>
  744</p>
  <p>The Holy Spirit brought to fulfillment in Mary all the waiting and the 
preparation of the Old Testament for the coming of Christ. In a singular way he 
filled her with grace and made her virginity fruitful so that she could give 
birth to the Son of God made flesh. He made her the Mother of the "whole 
Christ", that is, of Jesus the Head and of the Church his body. Mary was present 
with the twelve on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit inaugurated the 
"last days" with the manifestation of the Church.</p>
  <p><b>143. What is the relationship between the Spirit and Christ Jesus in his earthly 
mission?</b></p>
  <p>727-730<BR>745-746&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Beginning with his Incarnation, the Son of God was consecrated in his humanity 
as the Messiah by means of the anointing of the Spirit. He revealed the Spirit 
in his teaching, fulfilled the promises made to the Fathers, and bestowed him 
upon the Church at its birth when he breathed on the apostles after the 
Resurrection. </p>
  <p><b>144. What happened at Pentecost?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>731-732<br>
  738</p>
  <p>Fifty days after the Resurrection at Pentecost the glorified Jesus Christ poured 
out the Spirit in abundance and revealed him as a divine Person so that the Holy 
Trinity was fully manifest. The mission of Christ and of the Spirit became the 
mission of the Church which is sent to proclaim and spread the mystery of the 
communion of the Holy Trinity.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"We have seen the true Light, we have received the heavenly Spirit, 
we have found the true faith: we adore the indivisible Trinity, who has saved 
us." </i>(Byzantine Liturgy, Troparion of Vespers of Pentecost)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>145. What does the Spirit do in the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>733-741<br>
  747</p>
  <p>The Spirit builds, animates and sanctifies the Church. As the Spirit of Love, he 
restores to the baptized the divine likeness that was lost through sin and 
causes them to live in Christ the very life of the Holy Trinity. He sends them 
forth to bear witness to the Truth of Christ and he organizes them in their 
respective functions so that all might bear "the fruit of the Spirit" (<i>Galatians</i> 
5:22).</p>
  <p><b>146. How do Christ and his Spirit act in the hearts of the faithful?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>738-741</p>
  <p>Christ communicates his Spirit and the grace of God through the <i>sacraments</i> 
to all the members of the Church, who thus bear the fruits of the <i>new life</i> 
of the Spirit. The Holy Spirit is also the Master of <i>prayer</i>.</p>

  <p><b>147. What does the word <i>Church</i> mean?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>751-752<br>
  777,804</p>
  <p>The word <i>Church</i> refers to the people whom God calls and gathers together 
from every part of the earth. They form the assembly of those who through faith 
and Baptism have become children of God, members of Christ, and temples of the 
Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>148. Are there other names and images with which the Bible speaks about the 
Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>753-757&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In Sacred Scripture we find many images which bring out various complementary 
aspects of the mystery of the Church. The Old Testament favors those images that 
are bound to the <i>people of God</i>. The New Testament offers images that are 
linked to Christ as the Head of this people which is his Body. Other images are 
drawn from pastoral life (sheepfold, flock, sheep), from agriculture (field, 
olive grove, vineyard), from construction (dwelling place, stone, temple), and 
from family life (spouse, mother, family). </p>
  <p><b>149. What is the origin and the fulfillment of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>758-766<br>
  778</p>
  <p>The Church finds her origin and fulfillment in the eternal plan of God. She was 
prepared for in the Old Covenant with the election of Israel, the sign of the 
future gathering of all the nations.  Founded by the words and actions of Jesus Christ, fulfilled by his redeeming 
death and Resurrection, the Church has been manifested as the mystery of 
salvation by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. She will be 
perfected in the glory of heaven as the assembly of all the redeemed of the 
earth.</p>
  <p><b>150. What is the mission of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>767-769</p>
  <p>The mission of the Church is to proclaim and establish the Kingdom of God begun 
by Jesus Christ among all peoples. The Church constitutes on earth the seed and 
beginning of this salvific Kingdom.</p>
  <p><b>151. In what way is the Church a <i>mystery</i>?</b></p>
  <p>770-773<BR>779</p>
  <p>The Church is a mystery in as much as in her visible reality there is present 
and active a divine spiritual reality which can only be seen with the eyes of 
faith.</p>
  <p><b>152. What does it mean to say that the Church is the universal sacrament of 
salvation?</b></p>
  <p>774-776<BR>780&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This means that she is the sign and instrument both of the reconciliation and 
communion of all of humanity with God and of the unity of the entire human race.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#663300" size="4"><b><i>The Church: people of God,  <BR>body of Christ, temple of

  <p><b>153. Why is the Church the "people of God"?</b></p>
  <p>781<br>
  802-804</p>
  <p>The Church is the "people of God" because it pleased God to sanctify and save 
men not in isolation but by making them into one people gathered together by the 
unity of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>154. What are the characteristics of the people of God?</b></p>
  <p>782<BR>804</p>
  <p>One becomes a member of this people through faith in Christ and Baptism. This 
people has for its <i>origin</i> God the Father; for its <i>head</i> Jesus 
Christ; for its <i>hallmark</i> the dignity and freedom of the sons of God; for 
its <i>law</i> the new commandment of love; for its <i>mission</i> to be the 
salt of the earth and the light of the world; and for its <i>destiny</i> the 
Kingdom of God, already begun on earth.</p>
  <p><b>155. In what way does the people of God share in the three functions of Christ 
as Priest, Prophet and King?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>783-786</p>
  <p>The people of God participate in Christ&#39;s <i>priestly</i> office insofar as the 
baptized are consecrated by the Holy Spirit to offer spiritual sacrifices. They 
share in Christ"s <i>prophetic</i> office when with a supernatural sense of 
faith they adhere unfailingly to that faith and deepen their understanding and 
witness to it. The people of God share in his <i>kingly</i> office by means of 
service, imitating Jesus Christ who as King of the universe made himself the 
servant of all, especially the poor and the suffering.</p>
  <p><b>156. In what way is the Church the body of Christ?</b></p>
  <p>787-791<br>
  805-806</p>
  <p>The risen Christ unites his faithful people to himself in an intimate way by 
means of the Holy Spirit. In this way, those who believe in Christ, in as much 
as they are close to him especially in the Eucharist, are united among 
themselves in charity. They form one body, the Church, whose unity is 
experienced in the diversity of its members and its functions.</p>
  <p><b>157. Who is the Head of this body?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>792-795<br>
  807</p>
  <p>Christ "is the Head of the body, the Church" (<i>Colossians</i> 1:18). The Church lives 
from him, in him and for him. Christ and the Church make up the "whole Christ" 
(Saint Augustine); "Head and members form, as it were, one and the same mystical 
person" (Saint Thomas Aquinas). </p>
  <p><b>158. Why is the Church called the "Bride of Christ"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>796<br>
  808</p>
  <p>She is called the "Bride of Christ" because the Lord himself called himself her 
"Spouse" (<i>Mark</i>  2:19). The Lord has loved the Church and has joined her to himself in an everlasting 
covenant. He has given himself up for her in order to purify her with his blood 
and "sanctify her" (<i>Ephesians</i> 5:26), making her the fruitful mother of all the 
children of God. While the term "body" expresses the unity of the "head" with 
the members, the term "bride" emphasizes the distinction of the two in their 
personal relationship.</p>
  <p><b>159. Why is the Church called the temple of the Holy Spirit?</b></p>
  <p>797-798<BR>809-810</p>
  <p>She is so called because the Holy Spirit resides in the body which is the 
Church, in her Head and in her members. He also builds up the Church in charity 
by the Word of God, the sacraments, the virtues, and <i>charisms</i>.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"What the soul is to the human body, the Holy Spirit is to the 
members of Christ, that is, the body of Christ, which is the Church." </i>(Saint 
Augustine)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>160. What are charisms?</b></p>
  <p>799-801</p>
  <p>Charisms are special gifts of the Holy Spirit which are bestowed on individuals 
for the good of others, the needs of the world, and in particular for the 
building up of the Church. The discernment of charisms is the responsibility of 
the Magisterium.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><i><font color="#663300" size="4">The Church is one, holy, catholic, and 
apostolic</font></i></b></p>
  <p><b>161. Why is the Church <i>one</i>?</b></p>
  <p>813-815<BR>866<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The Church is one because she has as her source and exemplar the unity of the 
Trinity of Persons in one God. As her Founder and Head, Jesus Christ 
re-established the unity of all people in one body. As her soul, the Holy Spirit 
unites all the faithful in communion with Christ. The Church has but one faith, 
one sacramental life, one apostolic succession, one common hope, and one and the 
same charity.</p>
  <p><b>162. Where does the one Church of Christ subsist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>816<br>
  870</p>
  <p>The one Church of Christ, as a society constituted and organized in the world, 
subsists in (<i>subsistit in</i>) the Catholic Church, governed by the Successor 
of Peter and the bishops in communion with him. Only through this Church can one 
obtain the fullness of the means of salvation since the Lord has entrusted all 
the blessings of the New Covenant to the apostolic college alone whose head is 
Peter.</p>
  <p><b>163. How are non-Catholic Christians to be considered?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>817-819<br>
  870</p>
  <p>In the churches and ecclesial communities which are separated from full 
communion with the Catholic Church, many elements of sanctification and truth 
can be found. All of these blessings come from Christ and lead to Catholic 
unity. Members of these churches and communities are incorporated into Christ by 
Baptism and we so we recognize them as brothers.</p>
  <p><b>164. How does one commit oneself to work for the unity of Christians?</b></p>
  <p>820-822<br clear="ALL">
  866</p>
  <p>The desire to restore the unity of all Christians is a gift from Christ and a 
call of the Spirit. This desire involves the entire Church and it is pursued by 
conversion of heart, prayer, fraternal knowledge of each other and theological 
dialogue.</p>
  <p><b>165. In what way is the Church <i>holy</i>?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>823-829&nbsp;<br>
  867</p>
  <p>The Church is holy insofar as the Most Holy God is her author. Christ has given 
himself for her to sanctify her and make her a source of sanctification. The 
Holy Spirit gives her life with charity. In the Church one finds the fullness of 
the means of salvation. Holiness is the vocation of each of her members and the 
purpose of all her activities. The Church counts among her members the Virgin 
Mary and numerous Saints who are her models and intercessors. The holiness of 
the Church is the fountain of sanctification for her children who here on earth 
recognize themselves as sinners ever in need of conversion and purification.</p>
  <p><b>166. Why is the Church called "<i>Catholic</i>"?</b></p>
  <p>830-831<BR>868<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The Church is <i>catholic</i>, that is <i>universal</i>, insofar as Christ is 
present in her: "Where there is Christ Jesus, there is the Catholic Church" 
(Saint Ignatius of Antioch). The Church proclaims the fullness and the totality 
of the faith; she bears and administers the fullness of the means of salvation; 
she is sent out by Christ on a mission to the whole of the human race. </p>
  <p><b>167. Is the particular Church catholic?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>832-835</p>
  <p>Every <i>particular</i> Church (that is, a <i>diocese</i> or <i>eparchy</i>) is 
catholic. It is formed by a community of Christians who are in communion of 
faith and of the sacraments both with their Bishop, who is ordained in apostolic 
succession, and with the Church of Rome which "presides in charity" (Saint 
Ignatius of Antioch).</p>
  <p><b>168. Who belongs to the Catholic Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>836-838</p>
  <p>All human beings in various ways belong to or are ordered to the Catholic unity 
of the people of God.  Fully incorporated into the Catholic Church are those who, possessing the Spirit 
of Christ, are joined to the Church by the bonds of the profession of faith, the 
sacraments, ecclesiastical government and communion. The baptized who do not enjoy full Catholic unity are in a certain, although 
imperfect, communion with the Catholic Church.</p>
  <p><b>169. What is the relationship of the Catholic Church with the Jewish people?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>839-840&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Catholic Church recognizes a particular link with the Jewish people in the 
fact that God chose them before all others to receive his Word. To the Jewish 
people belong "the sonship, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the 
worship, the promises, and the patriarchs; and of their race, according to the 
flesh, is the Christ" (Romans 9:4, 5). The Jewish faith, unlike other 
non-Christian religions, is already a response to the revelation of God in the 
Old Covenant.</p>
  <p><b>170. What is the bond that exists between the Catholic Church and non-Christian 
religions?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>841-845&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There is a bond between all peoples which comes especially from the common 
origin and end of the entire human race. The Catholic Church recognizes that 
whatever is good or true in other religions comes from God and is a reflection 
of his truth. As such it can prepare for the acceptance of the Gospel and act as 
a stimulus toward the unity of humanity in the Church of Christ.</p>
  <p><b>171. What is the meaning of the affirmation "Outside the Church there is no 
salvation"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>846-848</p>
  <p>This means that all salvation comes from Christ, the Head, through the Church 
which is his body. Hence they cannot be saved who, knowing the Church as founded 
by Christ and necessary for salvation, would refuse to enter her or remain in 
her. At the same time, thanks to Christ and to his Church, those who through no 
fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ and his Church but sincerely 
seek God and, moved by grace, try to do his will as it is known through the 
dictates of conscience can attain eternal salvation.</p>
  <p><b>172. Why must the Church proclaim the Gospel to the whole world?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>849-851</p>
  <p>The Church must do so because Christ has given the command: "Go therefore and 
make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of 
the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (<i>Matthew</i> 28:19). This missionary mandate of the 
Lord has its origin in the eternal love of God who has sent his Son and the Holy 
Spirit because "he desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of 
the truth" (<i>1 Timothy</i> 2:4).</p>
  <p><b>173. In what sense is the Church missionary?</b></p>
  <p>852-856</p>
  <p>The Church, guided by the Holy Spirit, continues the mission of Christ himself 
in the course of history. Christians must, therefore, proclaim to everyone the 
Good News borne by Christ; and, following his path, they must be ready for 
self-sacrifice, even unto martyrdom.</p>
  <p><b>174. Why is the Church <i>apostolic</i>?</b></p>
  <p>857<BR>869&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Church is apostolic in her <i>origin</i> because she has been built on "the 
foundation of the Apostles" (<i>Ephesians</i> 2:20). She is apostolic in her <i>
teaching</i> which is the same as that of the Apostles. She is apostolic by 
reason of her <i>structure</i> insofar as she is taught, sanctified, and guided 
until Christ returns by the Apostles through their successors who are the 
bishops in communion with the successor of Peter. </p>
  <p><b>175. In what does the mission of the Apostles consist?</b></p>
  <p>858-861</p>
  <p>The Word "<i>Apostle</i>" means "one who is sent". Jesus, the One sent by the 
Father, called to himself twelve of his disciples and appointed them as his 
Apostles, making them the chosen witnesses of his Resurrection and the 
foundation of his Church. He gave them the command to continue his own mission 
saying, "As the Father has sent me, so I also send you" (<i>John</i> 20:21); and he 
promised to remain with them until the end of the world.</p>
  <p><b>176. What is apostolic succession?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>861-865</p>
  <p>Apostolic succession is the transmission by means of the sacrament of Holy 
Orders of the mission and power of the Apostles to their successors, the 
bishops. Thanks to this transmission the Church remains in communion of faith 
and life with her origin, while through the centuries she carries on her 
apostolate for the spread of the Kingdom of Christ on earth.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#663300" size="4"><i> <b>The Faithful: hierarchy, laity, 
consecrated life</b></i></font></p>
  <p><b>177. Who are the faithful?</b></p>
  <p>871-872<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The Christian faithful are those who, inasmuch as they have been incorporated in 
Christ through Baptism, have been constituted as the people of God; for this 
reason, since they have become sharers in Christ"s priestly, prophetic and royal 
office in their own manner, they are called to exercise the mission which God 
has entrusted to the Church.  There exists a true equality among them in their dignity as children of God. 
  </p>
  <p><b>178. How are the people of God formed?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>873<br>
  934</p>
  <p>Among the faithful&nbsp;by divine institution there exist <i>sacred ministers</i> who have 
received the sacrament of Holy Orders and who form the hierarchy of the Church. 
The other members of the Church are called the <i>laity</i>. In both the 
hierarchy and the laity there are certain of the faithful who are <i>consecrated</i> 
in a special manner to God by the profession of the evangelical counsels: 
chastity or celibacy, poverty, and obedience.</p>
  <p><b>179. Why did Christ institute an ecclesiastical hierarchy?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>874-876&nbsp;<br>
  935</p>
  <p>Christ instituted an ecclesiastical hierarchy with the mission of feeding the 
people of God in his name and for this purpose gave it authority. The hierarchy 
is formed of sacred ministers,; bishops, priests, and deacons. Thanks to the 
sacrament of Orders, bishops and priests act in the exercise of their ministry 
in the name and person of Christ the Head. Deacons minister to the people of God 
in the <i>diakonia</i> (service) of word, liturgy, and charity.</p>
  <p><b>180. How is the collegial dimension of Church ministry carried out?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>876-877</p>
  <p>After the example of the twelve Apostles who were chosen and sent out together 
by Christ, the unity of the Church"s hierarchy is at the service of the 
communion of all the faithful. Every bishop exercises his ministry as a member 
of the episcopal college in communion with the Pope and shares with him in the 
care of the universal Church. Priests exercise their ministry in the 
presbyterate of the local Church in communion with their own bishop and under 
his direction.</p>
  <p><b>181. Why does ecclesial ministry also have a personal character?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>878-879&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Ecclesial ministry also has a personal character in as much as each minister, in 
virtue of the sacrament of Holy Orders, is responsible before Christ who called 
him personally and conferred on him his mission. </p>
  <p><b>182. What is the mission of the Pope?</b></p>
  <p>880-882<BR>936-937<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>The Pope, Bishop of Rome and the Successor of Saint Peter, is the perpetual, 
visible source and foundation of the unity of the Church. He is the vicar of 
Christ, the head of the College of bishops and pastor of the universal Church 
over which he has by divine institution full, supreme, immediate, and universal 
power.</p>
  <p><b>183. What is the competence of the college of bishops?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>883-885</p>
  <p>The college of bishops in union with the Pope, and never without him, also 
exercises supreme and full authority over the Church. </p>
  <p><b>184. How do the bishops carry out their mission of teaching?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>888-890<br>
  939</p>
  <p>Since they are authentic witnesses of the apostolic faith and are invested with 
the authority of Christ, the bishops in union with the Pope have the duty of 
proclaiming the Gospel faithfully and authoritatively to all. By means of a 
supernatural sense of faith, the people of God unfailingly adhere to the faith 
under the guidance of the living Magisterium of the Church.</p>
  <p><b>185. When is the infallibility of the Magisterium exercised?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>890-891</p>
  <p>Infallibility is exercised when the Roman Pontiff, in virtue of his office as 
the Supreme Pastor of the Church, or the College of Bishops, in union with the 
Pope especially when joined together in an Ecumenical Council, proclaim by a 
definitive act a doctrine pertaining to faith or morals. Infallibility is also 
exercised when the Pope and Bishops in their ordinary Magisterium are in 
agreement in proposing a doctrine as definitive. Every one of the faithful must 
adhere to such teaching with the obedience of faith.</p>
  <p><b>186. How do Bishops exercise their ministry of sanctification?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>893</p>
  <p>Bishops sanctify the Church by dispensing the grace of Christ by their ministry 
of the word and the sacraments, especially the Holy Eucharist, and also by their 
prayers, their example and their work.</p>
  <p><b>187. How do the Bishops exercise their function of governing?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>894-896</p>
  <p>Every bishop, insofar as he is a member of the college of bishops, bears 
collegially the care for all particular Churches and for the entire Church along 
with all the other bishops who are united to the Pope. A bishop to whom a 
particular Church has been entrusted governs that Church with the authority of 
his own sacred power which is ordinary and immediate and exercised in the name 
of Christ, the Good Shepherd, in communion with the entire Church and under the 
guidance of the Successor of Peter.</p>
  <p><b>188. What is the vocation of the lay faithful?</b></p>
  <p>897-900<BR>940<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The lay faithful have as their own vocation to seek the Kingdom of God by 
illuminating and ordering temporal affairs according to the plan of God. They 
carry out in this way their call to holiness and to the apostolate, a call given 
to all the baptized.</p>
  <p><b>189. How do the lay faithful participate in the priestly office of Christ?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>901-903&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They participate in it especially in the Eucharist by offering as a spiritual 
sacrifice "acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (<i>1 Peter </i>2:5) their own lives 
with all of their works, their prayers, their apostolic undertakings, their 
family life, their daily work and hardships borne with patience and even their 
consolations of spirit and body. In this way, even the laity, dedicated to 
Christ and consecrated by the Holy Spirit, offer to God the world itself.</p>
  <p><b>190. How does the laity participate in the prophetic office?</b></p>
  <p>904-907<BR>942<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>They participate in it by welcoming evermore in faith the Word of Christ and 
proclaiming it to the world by the witness of their lives, their words, their 
evangelizing action, and by catechesis. This evangelizing action acquires a 
particular efficacy because it is accomplished in the ordinary circumstances of 
the world.</p>
  <p><b>191. How do they participate in the kingly office?</b></p>
  <p>908-913<BR>943<o:p></o:p></p>

  <p>The laity participate in the kingly function of Christ because they have 
received from him the power to overcome sin in themselves and in the world by 
self-denial and the holiness of their lives. They exercise various ministries at 
the service of the community and they imbue temporal activities and the 
institutions of society with moral values.</p>
  <p><b>192. What is the consecrated life?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>914-916&nbsp;<br>
  944</p>
  <p>The consecrated life is a state of life recognized by the Church. It is a free 
response to a special call from Christ by which those consecrated give 
themselves completely to God and strive for the perfection of charity moved by 
the Holy Spirit. This consecration is characterized by the practice of the 
evangelical counsels.</p>
  <p><b>193. What can the consecrated life give to the mission of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>931-933&nbsp;<br>
  945</p>
  <p>The consecrated life participates in the mission of the Church by means of a 
complete dedication to Christ and to one"s brothers and sisters witnessing to 
the hope of the heavenly Kingdom.</p>

saints</i></b></font></p>
  <p><b>194. What is the meaning of the "communion of saints"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>946-953<br>
  960</p>
  <p>This expression indicates first of all the common sharing of all the members of 
the Church in holy things (<i>sancta</i>): the faith, the sacraments, especially 
the Eucharist, the charisms, and the other spiritual gifts. At the root of this 
communion is love which "does not seek its own interests" (<i>1 Corinthians </i>13:5) 
but leads the faithful to "hold everything in common" (<i>Acts</i> 4:32), even to put 
one"s own material goods at the service of the most poor.</p>
  <p><b>195. What else does "the communion of saints" mean?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>954-959&nbsp;<br>
  961-962</p>
  <p>This expression also refers to the communion between holy persons <i>(sancti)</i>; 
that is, between those who by grace are united to the dead and risen Christ. 
Some are pilgrims on the earth; others, having passed from this life, are 
undergoing purification and are helped also by our prayers. Others already enjoy 
the glory of God and intercede for us. All of these together form in Christ one 
family, the Church, to the praise and glory of the Trinity.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#663300" size="4"><i> <b>Mary, Mother of Christ, Mother of the 
Church</b></i></font></p>
  <p><b>196. In what sense is the Blessed Virgin Mary the Mother of the Church?</b></p>
  <p>963-964<BR>973&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Blessed Virgin Mary is the Mother of the Church in the order of grace 
because she gave birth to Jesus, the Son of God, the Head of the body which is 
the Church. When he was dying on the cross Jesus gave his mother to his disciple 
with the words, "Behold your mother" (<i>John</i> 19:27).</p>
  <p><b>197. How does the Virgin Mary help the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>965-970<br>
  974-975</p>
  <p>After the Ascension of her Son, the Virgin Mary aided the beginnings of the 
Church with her prayers. Even after her Assumption into heaven, she continues to 
intercede for her children, to be a model of faith and charity for all, and to 
exercise over them a salutary influence deriving from the superabundant merits 
of Christ. The faithful see in Mary an image and an anticipation of the 
resurrection that awaits them and they invoke her as advocate, helper, 
benefactress and mediatrix.</p>
  <p><b>198. What kind of devotion is directed to the holy Virgin?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>971</p>
  <p>It is a singular kind of devotion which differs essentially from the cult of 
adoration given only to the Most Holy Trinity. This special veneration directed 
to Mary finds particular expression in the liturgical feasts dedicated to the 
Mother of God and in Marian prayers such as the holy Rosary which is a 
compendium of the whole Gospel.</p>
  <p><b>199. In what way is the Blessed Virgin Mary the eschatological icon of the 
Church?</b></p>
  <p>972</p>
  <p>Looking upon Mary, who is completely holy and already glorified in body and 
soul, the Church contemplates in her what she herself is called to be on earth 
and what she will be in the homeland of heaven.</p>

  <p><b>200. How are sins remitted?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>976-980&nbsp;<br>
  984-985</p>
  <p>The first and chief sacrament for the forgiveness of sins is Baptism. For those 
sins committed after Baptism, Christ instituted the sacrament of Reconciliation 
or Penance through which a baptized person is reconciled with God and with the 
Church.</p>
  <p><b>201. Why does the Church have the power to forgive sins?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>981-983&nbsp;<br>
  986-987</p>
  <p>The Church has the mission and the power to forgive sins because Christ himself 
has conferred it upon her: "Receive the Holy Spirit, if you forgive the sins of 
any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained" (<i>John</i> 
20:22-23).</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">"I BELIEVE IN THE RESURRECTION OF THE BODY"</font></b></p>
  <p><b>202. What is the meaning of the term "body" (or "<i>flesh</i>") and what 
importance does it have?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>990&nbsp;<br>
  1015</p>
  <p>The resurrection of the <i>flesh</i> is the literal formulation in the Apostles 
Creed for the resurrection of the body. The term "flesh" refers to humanity in 
its state of weakness and mortality. "The flesh is the hinge of salvation" 
(Tertullian). We believe in God the Creator of the flesh; we believe in the Word 
made flesh in order to redeem flesh; and we believe in the resurrection of flesh 
which is the fulfillment of both the creation and the redemption of the flesh.</p>
  <p><b>203. What is meant by the "resurrection of the body"? </b></p>
  <p>990</p>
  <p>This means that the definitive state of man will not be one in which his 
spiritual soul is separated from his body. Even our mortal bodies will one day 
come to life again.</p>
  <p><b>204. What is the relationship between the Resurrection of Christ and our 
resurrection?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>998<br>
  1002-1003</p>
  <p>Just as Christ is truly risen from the dead and now lives forever, so he himself 
will raise everyone on the last day with an incorruptible body: "Those who have 
done good will rise to the resurrection of life and those who have done evil to 
the resurrection of condemnation" (<i>John</i> 5:29). </p>
  <p><b>205. What happens to our body and our soul after death?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>992-1004<br>
  1016-1018</p>
  <p>After death, which is the separation of the body and the soul, the body becomes 
corrupt while the soul, which is immortal, goes to meet the judgment of God and 
awaits its reunion with the body when it will rise transformed at the time of 
the return of the Lord. <i>How</i> the resurrection of the body will come about 
exceeds the possibilities of our imagination and understanding.</p>
  <p><b>206. What does it mean to die in Christ Jesus?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1005-1014<br>
  1019</p>
  <p>Dying in Christ Jesus means to die in the state of God&#39;s grace without any 
mortal sin. A believer in Christ, following his example, is thus able to 
transform his own death into an act of obedience and love for the Father. "This 
saying is sure: if we have died with him, we will also live with him" (2 <i>Timothy</i> 
2:11).</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">"I BELIEVE IN LIFE EVERLASTING"</font></b></p>
  <p><b>207. What is life everlasting?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1020&nbsp;<br>
  1051</p>
  <p>Eternal life is that life which begins immediately after death. It will have no 
end. It will be preceded for each person by a particular judgment at the hands 
of Christ who is the Judge of the living and the dead. This particular judgement 
will be confirmed in the final judgment.</p>
  <p><b>208. What is the particular judgment?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1021-1022<br>
  1051</p>
  <p>It is the judgment of immediate retribution which each one after death will 
receive from God in his immortal soul in accord with his faith and his works. 
This retribution consists in entrance into the happiness of heaven, immediately 
or after an appropriate purification, or entry into the eternal damnation of 
hell.</p>
  <p><b>209. What is meant by the term "heaven"?</b></p>
  <p>1023-1026<br>
  1053</p>
  <p>By "heaven" is meant the state of supreme and definitive happiness. Those who 
die in the grace of God and have no need of further purification are gathered 
around Jesus and Mary, the angels and the saints. They thus form the Church of 
heaven, where they see God "face to face" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 13:12). They live in a 
communion of love with the Most Blessed Trinity and they intercede for us.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"True and subsistent life consists in this: the Father, through the 
Son and in the Holy Spirit, pouring out his heavenly gifts on all things without 
exception. Thanks to his mercy, we too, men that we are, have received the 
inalienable promise of eternal life."</i> (Saint Cyril of Jerusalem)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>210. What is purgatory?</b></p>
  <p>1030-1031<br>
  1054</p>
  <p>Purgatory is the state of those who die in God"s friendship, assured of their 
eternal salvation, but who still have need of purification to enter into the 
happiness of heaven. </p>
  <p><b>211. How can we help the souls being purified in purgatory?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1032</p>
  <p>Because of the communion of saints, the faithful who are still pilgrims on earth 
are able to help the souls in purgatory by offering prayers in suffrage for 
them, especially the Eucharistic sacrifice. They also help them by almsgiving, 
indulgences, and works of penance.</p>
  <p><b>212. In what does hell consist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1033-1035&nbsp;<br>
  1056-1057</p>
  <p>Hell consists in the eternal damnation of those who die in mortal sin through 
their own free choice. The principal suffering of hell is eternal separation 
from God in whom alone we can have the life and happiness for which we were 
created and for which we long. Christ proclaimed this reality with the words, 
"Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire" (<i>Matthew</i> 25:41).</p>
  <p><b>213. How can one reconcile the existence of hell with the infinite goodness of 
God?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1036-1037</p>
  <p>God, while desiring "all to come to repentance" (<i>2 Peter</i> 3:9), nevertheless has 
created the human person to be free and responsible; and he respects our 
decisions. Therefore, it is the human person who freely excludes himself from 
communion with God if at the moment of death he persists in mortal sin and 
refuses the merciful love of God.</p>
  <p><b>214. In what does the final judgment consist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1038-1041&nbsp;<br>
  1058-1059</p>
  <p>The final or universal judgment consists in a sentence of happiness or eternal 
condemnation, which the Lord Jesus will issue in regard to the "just and the 
unjust" (<i>Acts</i> 24:15) when he returns as the Judge of the living and the dead. 
After the last judgment, the resurrected body will share in the retribution 
which the soul received at the particular judgment.</p>
  <p><b>215. When will this judgment occur?</b></p>
  <p>1040</p>
  <p>This judgment will come at the end of the world and only God knows the day and 
the hour.</p>
  <p><b>216. What is the hope of the new heavens and the new earth?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1042-1050<br>
  1060</p>
  <p>After the final judgment the universe itself, freed from its bondage to decay, 
will share in the glory of Christ with the beginning of "the new heavens" and a 
"new earth" (<i>2 Peter </i>3:13). Thus, the fullness of the Kingdom of God will come 
about, that is to say, the definitive realization of the salvific plan of God to 
"unite all things in Christ, things in heaven and things on earth" (<i>Ephesians</i> 
1:10). God will then be "all in all" (<i>1 Corinthians </i>15:28) in eternal life.</p>
  <p align="center"><i><font color="#663300"> <b><font size="4">"Amen"</font></b></font></i></p>
  <p><b>217. What is the meaning of the word "<i>Amen</i>" with which we conclude our 
profession of faith?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1061-1065</p>
  <p>The Hebrew word "<i>Amen</i>", which also concludes the last book of Sacred 
Scripture, some of the prayers of the New Testament, and the liturgical prayers 
of the Church, expresses our confident and total "yes" to what we professed in 
the Creed, entrusting ourselves completely to him who is the definitive "<i>Amen</i>" 
(<i>Revelation</i> 3:14), Christ the Lord.</p>

  <p><b>218. What is the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1066-1070<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The liturgy is the celebration of the mystery of Christ and in particular his 
paschal mystery. Through the exercise of the priestly office of Jesus Christ the 
liturgy manifests 
in signs and brings about the sanctification of humankind.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The public worship which is due to God is offered by the Mystical Body of 
Christ, that is, by its head and by its members.</p>
  <p><b>219. What place does the liturgy occupy in the life of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1071-1075</p>
  <p>The liturgy as the sacred action <i>par excellence</i> is the summit toward 
which the activity of the Church is directed and it is likewise the font from 
which all her power flows. Through the liturgy Christ continues the work of our 
redemption in, with and through his Church.</p>
  <p><b>220. In what does the sacramental economy consist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1076</p>
  <p>The sacramental economy consists in the communication of the fruits of Christ"s 
redemption through the celebration of the sacraments of the Church, most 
especially that of the Eucharist, "until he comes" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 11:26).</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE LITURGY - WORK OF THE MOST HOLY TRINITY</font></b></p>
  <p><b>221. In what way is the Father the source and the goal of the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p>1077-1083<BR>1110</p>
  <p>Through&nbsp;the liturgy the Father fills us with his blessings in the Word made flesh 
who died and rose for us and pours into our hearts the Holy Spirit. At the same 
time, the Church blesses the Father by her worship, praise, and thanksgiving and 
begs him for the gift of his Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>222. What is the work of Christ in the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1084-1090</p>
  <p>In the liturgy of the Church, it is his own paschal mystery that Christ 
signifies and makes present. By giving the Holy Spirit to his apostles he 
entrusted to them and their successors the power to make present the work of 
salvation through the Eucharistic sacrifice and the sacraments, in which he 
himself acts to communicate his grace to the faithful of all times and places 
throughout the world.</p>
  <p><b>223. How does the Holy Spirit work in the liturgy of the Church?</b></p>
  <p>1091-1109<BR>1112</p>
  <p>The very closest cooperation is at work in the liturgy between the Holy Spirit 
and the Church. The Holy Spirit prepares the Church to encounter her Lord. He 
recalls and manifests Christ to the faith of the assembly. He makes the mystery 
of Christ really present. He unites the Church to the life and mission of Christ 
and makes the gift of communion bear fruit in the Church.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE PASCHAL MYSTERY IN THE SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH 
  </font></b></p>
  <p><b>224. What are the sacraments and which are they?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1113-1131</p>
  <p>The sacraments, instituted by Christ and entrusted to the Church, are 
efficacious signs of grace perceptible to the senses . Through them divine life 
is bestowed upon us. There are seven sacraments: Baptism, Confirmation, Holy 
Eucharist, Penance, Anointing of the Sick, Holy Orders, and Matrimony.</p>
  <p><b>225. What is the relationship of the sacraments to Christ?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1114-1116&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The mysteries of Christ"s life are the foundations of what he would henceforth 
dispense in the sacraments, through the ministers of his Church.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"What was visible in our Savior has passed over into his mysteries." </i>
    (Saint Leo the Great)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>226. What is the link between the sacraments and the Church?</b></p>
  <p>1117-1119</p>
  <p>Christ has entrusted the sacraments to his Church. They are the sacraments "of 
the Church" in a twofold sense: they are "from her" insofar as they are actions 
of the Church which is the sacrament of Christ"s action; and they are "for her" 
in as much as they build up the Church.</p>
  <p><b>227. What is the <i>sacramental</i> character?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1121&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is a spiritual "<i>seal</i>" bestowed by the sacraments of Baptism, 
Confirmation, and Holy Orders. It is a promise and guarantee of divine 
protection. By virtue of this seal the Christian is configured to Christ, 
participates in a variety of ways in his priesthood and takes his part in the 
Church according to different states and functions. He is, therefore, set apart 
for divine worship and the service of the Church. Because this character is 
indelible the sacraments that impress it on the soul are received only once in 
life.</p>
  <p><b>228. What is the relationship between the sacraments and faith?</b></p>
  <p>1122-1126<br>
  1133</p>
  <p>The sacraments not only presuppose faith but with words and ritual elements they 
nourish, strengthen, and express it. By celebrating the sacraments, the Church 
professes the faith that comes from the apostles. This explains the origin of 
the ancient saying, "<i>lex orandi, lex credendi,</i>"<i> </i>that is, the 
Church believes as she prays.</p>
  <p><b>229. Why are the sacraments efficacious?</b></p>
  <p>1127-1128<BR>1131<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The sacraments are efficacious <i>ex opere operato </i>("by the very fact that 
the sacramental action is performed") because it is Christ who acts in the 
sacraments and communicates the grace they signify. The efficacy of the 
sacraments does not depend upon the personal holiness of the minister. However, 
the fruits of the sacraments do depend on the dispositions of the one who 
receives them. </p>
  <p><b>230. For what reason are the sacraments necessary for salvation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1129&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For believers in Christ the sacraments, even if they are not all given to each 
of the faithful, are necessary for salvation because they confer sacramental 
grace, forgiveness of sins, adoption as children of God, conformation to Christ 
the Lord and membership in the Church. The Holy Spirit heals and transforms 
those who receive the sacraments.</p>
  <p><b>231. What is sacramental grace?</b></p>
  <p>1129, 1131<BR>1134, 2003&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Sacramental grace is the grace of the Holy Spirit which is given by Christ and 
is proper to each sacrament. This grace helps the faithful in their journey 
toward holiness and so assists the Church as well to grow in charity and in her 
witness to the world.</p>
  <p><b>232. What is the relationship between the sacraments and everlasting life?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1130</p>
  <p>In the sacraments the Church already receives a foretaste of eternal life, while 
"awaiting in blessed hope, the appearing in glory of our great God and saviour 
Christ Jesus" (<i>Titus</i> 2:13).</p>

  <p><b>233. Who acts in the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p>1135-1137<BR>1187&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the liturgy it is the <i>whole Christ</i> (<i>Christus Totus</i>) who acts, 
Head and Body. As our High Priest he celebrates with his body, which is the 
Church in heaven and on earth.</p>
  <p><b>234. Who celebrates the heavenly liturgy?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1138-1139&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The heavenly liturgy is celebrated by the angels, by the saints of the Old and 
New Testament, particularly the Mother of God, by the Apostles, by the martyrs, 
and by the "great multitude which no one could number from every nation, race, 
people, and tongue." (<i>Revelation</i> 7:9). When we celebrate the mystery of our 
salvation in the sacraments we participate in this eternal liturgy.</p>
  <p><b>235. How does the Church on earth celebrate the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p>1140-1144<BR>1188</p>
  <p>The Church on earth celebrates the liturgy as a priestly people in which each 
one acts according to his proper function in the unity of the Holy Spirit. The 
baptized offer themselves in a spiritual sacrifice; the ordained ministers 
celebrate according to the Order they received for the service of all the 
members of the Church; the bishops and priests act in the Person of Christ the 
Head.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#663300" size="4"><b><i>How is the liturgy celebrated?</i></b></font></p>
  <p><b>236. How is the liturgy celebrated?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1145</p>
  <p>The celebration of the liturgy is interwoven with signs and symbols whose 
meaning is rooted in creation and in human culture. It is determined by the 
events of the Old Testament and is fully revealed in the Person and work of 
Christ. </p>
  <p><b>237. From where do the sacramental signs come?</b></p>
  <p>1146-1152<br>
  1189</p>
  <p>Some come from created things (light, water, fire, bread, wine, oil); others 
come from social life (washing, anointing, breaking of bread). Still others come 
from the history of salvation in the Old Covenant (the Passover rites, the 
sacrifices, the laying on of hands, the consecrations). These signs, some of 
which are normative and unchangeable, were taken up by Christ and are made the 
bearers of his saving and sanctifying action. </p>
  <p><b>238. What is the link between the actions and the words in the celebration of 
the sacraments? </b></p>
  <p>1153-1155<BR>1190&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Actions and words are very closely linked in the celebration of the sacraments. 
Indeed, even if the symbolic actions are already in themselves a language, it is 
necessary that the words of the rite accompany and give life to these actions. 
The liturgical words and actions are inseparable both insofar as they are 
meaningful signs and insofar as they bring about what they signify. </p>
  <p><b>239. What are the criteria for the proper use of singing and music in liturgical 
celebrations?</b></p>
  <p>1156-1158<BR>1191&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since song and music are closely connected with liturgical action they must 
respect the following criteria. They should conform to Catholic doctrine in 
their texts, drawn preferably from Sacred Scripture and liturgical sources. They 
should be a beautiful expression of prayer. The music should be of a high 
quality. Song and music should encourage the participation of the liturgical 
assembly. They should express the cultural richness of the People of God and the 
sacred and solemn character of the celebration. "He who sings, prays twice" 
(Saint Augustine).</p>
  <p><b>240. What is the purpose of holy images?</b></p>
  <p>1159-1161<BR>1192<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The image of Christ is the liturgical icon <i>par excellence</i>. Other images, 
representations of Our Lady and of the Saints, signify Christ who is glorified 
in them. They proclaim the same Gospel message that Sacred Scripture 
communicates by the word and they help to awaken and nourish the faith of 
believers.</p>

the memorials of saints who lived for Christ, who suffered with him, and who 
live with him in glory.</p>
  <p><b>243. What is the Liturgy of the Hours?</b></p>
  <p>1174-1178<BR>1196&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Liturgy of the Hours, which is the public and common prayer of the Church, 
is the prayer of Christ with his body, the Church. Through the Liturgy of the 
Hours the mystery of Christ, which we celebrate in the Eucharist, sanctifies and 
transforms the whole of each day. It is composed mainly of psalms, other 
biblical texts, and readings from the Fathers and spiritual masters.</p>
  <p align="center"><font color="#663300" size="4"><b><i>Where is the liturgy celebrated?</i></b></font></p>
  <p><b>244. Does the Church need places in order to celebrate the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p>1179-1181<BR>1197-1198<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>The worship "in spirit and truth" (<i>John</i> 4:24) of the New Covenant is not tied 
exclusively to any place because Christ is the true temple of God. Through him 
Christians and the whole Church become temples of the living God by the action 
of the Holy Spirit. Nonetheless, the people of God in their earthly condition 
need places in which the community can gather to celebrate the liturgy.</p>
  <p><b>245. What are sacred buildings?</b></p>
  <p>1181<br>
  1198-1199</p>
  <p>They are the houses of God, a symbol of the Church that lives in that place as 
well as of the heavenly Jerusalem. Above all they are places of prayer in which 
the Church celebrates the Eucharist and worships Christ who is truly present in 
the tabernacle.</p>
  <p><b>246. What are the privileged places inside sacred buildings?</b></p>
  <p>1182-1186</p>
  <p>They are: the altar, the tabernacle, the place where the sacred Chrism and other 
holy oils are kept, the chair of the bishop (cathedra) or the chair of the 
priest, the ambo, the baptismal font, and the confessional.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">LITURGICAL DIVERSITY AND THE UNITY OF THE MYSTERY</font></b></p>
  <p><b>247. Why is the one Mystery of Christ celebrated by the Church according to 
various liturgical traditions?</b></p>
  <p>1200-1204<BR>1207-1209</p>
  <p>The answer is that the unfathomable richness of the mystery of Christ cannot be 
exhausted by any single liturgical tradition. From the very beginning, 
therefore, this richness found expression among various peoples and cultures in 
ways that are characterized by a wonderful diversity and complementarity.</p>
  <p><b>248. What is the criterion that assures unity in the midst of plurality?</b></p>
  <p>1209</p>
  <p>It is fidelity to the Apostolic Tradition, that is, the communion in the faith 
and in the sacraments received from the apostles, a communion that is both 
signified and guaranteed by apostolic succession. The Church is Catholic and 
therefore can integrate into her unity all the authentic riches of cultures.</p>
  <p><b>249. Is everything immutable in the liturgy?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1205-1206</p>
  <p>In the liturgy, particularly in that of the sacraments, there are unchangeable 
elements because they are of divine institution. The Church is the faithful 
guardian of them. There are also, however, elements subject to change which the 
Church has the power and on occasion also the duty to adapt to the cultures of 
diverse peoples.</p>

  <p><b>250. How are the sacraments of the Church divided?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1210-1211</p>
  <p>The sacraments are divided into: the sacraments of Christian initiation 
(Baptism, Confirmation, and Holy Eucharist); the sacraments of healing (Penance 
and Anointing of the Sick);, and the sacraments at the service of communion and 
mission (Holy Orders and Matrimony). The sacraments touch all the important 
moments of Christian life. All of the sacraments are ordered to the Holy 
Eucharist "as to their end" (Saint Thomas Aquinas).</p>

  <a name="The sacraments of Christian initiation">The sacraments of Christian initiation</a></b></font></p>
  <p><b>251. How is Christian initiation brought about?</b></p>
  <p>1212<br>
  1275</p>
  <p>Christian initiation is accomplished by means of the sacraments which establish 
the <i>foundations</i> of Christian life. The faithful born anew by Baptism are 
strengthened by Confirmation and are then nourished by the Eucharist.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENT OF BAPTISM</font></b></p>
  <p><b>252. What names are given to the first sacrament of initiation?</b></p>
  <p>1213-1216<BR>1276-1277<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>This sacrament is primarily called&nbsp;<i>Baptism</i> because of the central rite with which it is celebrated. To 
baptize means to "immerse" in water. The one who is baptized is immersed into 
the death of Christ and rises with him as a "new creature" (<i>2 Corinthians</i> 5:17). 
This sacrament is also called the "bath of regeneration and renewal in the Holy 
Spirit" (<i>Titus</i> 3:5); and it is called "enlightenment" because the baptized 
becomes "a son of light" (<i>Ephesians</i> 5:8).</p>
  <p><b>253. How is Baptism prefigured in the Old Covenant?</b></p>
  <p>1217-1222</p>
  <p>In the Old Covenant Baptism was pre-figured in various ways: <i>water,</i> seen 
as source of life and of death; in <i>the Ark of Noah</i>, which saved by means 
of water; in <i>the passing through the Red Sea, </i>which liberated Israel from 
Egyptian slavery; in <i>the crossing of the Jordan River, </i>that brought 
Israel into the promised land which is the image of eternal life. </p>
  <p><b>254. Who brought to fulfillment those prefigurations?</b></p>
  <p>1223-1224</p>
  <p>All the Old Covenant prefigurations find their fulfillment in Jesus Christ. At 
the beginning of his public life Jesus had himself baptized by John the Baptist 
in the Jordan. On the cross, blood and water, signs of Baptism and the 
Eucharist, flowed from his pierced side. After his Resurrection he gave to his 
apostles this mission: "Go forth and make disciples of all nations, baptizing 
them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (<i>Matthew</i> 
28:19).</p>
  <p><b>255. Starting when and to whom has the Church administered Baptism?</b></p>
  <p>1226-1228</p>
  <p>From the day of Pentecost, the Church has administered Baptism to anyone who 
believes in Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p><b>256. In what does the essential rite of Baptism consist? </b></p>
  <p>1229-1245<BR>1278</p>
  <p>The essential rite of this sacrament consists in immersing the candidate in 
water or pouring water over his or her head while invoking the name of the 
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>257. Who can receive Baptism?</b></p>
  <p>1246-1252</p>
  <p>Every person not yet baptized is able to receive Baptism.</p>
  <p><b>258. Why does the Church baptize infants?</b></p>
  <p>1250</p>
  <p>The Church baptizes infants because they are born with original sin. They need 
to be freed from the power of the Evil One and brought into that realm of 
freedom which belongs to the children of God.</p>
  <p><b>259. What is required of one who is to be baptized?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1253-1255</p>
  <p>Everyone who is to be baptized is required to make a profession of faith. This 
is done personally in the case of an adult or by the parents and by the Church 
in the case of infants. Also the godfather or the godmother and the whole 
ecclesial community share the responsibility for baptismal preparation (catechumenate) 
as well as for the development and safeguarding of the faith and grace given at 
baptism.</p>
  <p><b>260. Who can baptize?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1256<br>
  1284</p>
  <p>The ordinary ministers of Baptism are the bishop and the priest. In the Latin 
Church the deacon also can baptize. In case of necessity any person can baptize 
provided he has the intention of doing what the Church does. This is done by 
pouring water on the head of the candidate while saying the Trinitarian formula 
for Baptism: "I baptize you in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the 
Holy Spirit".</p>
  <p><b>261. Is Baptism necessary for salvation?</b></p>
  <p>1257</p>
  <p>Baptism is necessary for salvation for all those to whom the Gospel has been 
proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament.</p>
  <p><b>262. Is it possible to be saved without Baptism?</b></p>
  <p>1258-1261<BR>1281-1283</p>
  <p>Since Christ died for the salvation of all, those can be saved without Baptism 
who die for the faith (<i>Baptism of blood</i>). Catechumens and all those who, 
even without knowing Christ and the Church, still (under the impulse of grace) 
sincerely seek God and strive to do his will can also be saved without Baptism (<i>Baptism 
of desire</i>). The Church in her liturgy entrusts children who die without 
Baptism to the mercy of God.</p>
  <p><b>263. What are the effects of Baptism?</b></p>
  <p>1262-1274<BR>1279-1280<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Baptism takes away original sin, all personal sins and all punishment due to 
sin. It makes the baptized person a participant in the divine life of the 
Trinity through sanctifying grace, the grace of justification which incorporates 
one into Christ and into his Church. It gives one a share in the priesthood of 
Christ and provides the basis for communion with all Christians. It bestows the 
theological virtues and the gifts of the Holy Spirit. A baptized person belongs 
forever to Christ. He is marked with the indelible seal of Christ (<i>character</i>).</p>
  <p><b>264. What is the meaning of the Christian name received at Baptism?</b></p>
  <p>2156-2159<BR>2167<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The name is important because God knows each of us by name, that is, in our 
uniqueness as persons. In Baptism a Christian receives his or her own name in 
the Church. It should preferably be the name of a saint who might offer the 
baptized a model of sanctity and an assurance of his or her intercession before 
God. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENT OF CONFIRMATION</font></b></p>
  <p><b>265. What place does Confirmation have in the divine plan of salvation?</b></p>
  <p>1285-1288<br>
  1315</p>
  <p>In the Old Testament the prophets announced that the Spirit of the Lord would 
rest on the awaited Messiah and on the entire messianic people. The whole life 
and mission of Jesus were carried out in total communion with the Holy Spirit. 
The apostles received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost and proclaimed "the great 
works of God" (<i>Acts</i> 2:11). They gave the gift of the same Spirit to the newly 
baptized by the laying on of hands. Down through the centuries, the Church has 
continued to live by the Spirit and to impart him to her children.</p>
  <p><b>266. Why is this sacrament called <i>Chrismation</i> or <i>Confirmation</i>?</b></p>
  <p>1289</p>
  <p>It is called <i>Chrismation</i> (in the Eastern Churches: Anointing with holy 
myron or chrism) because the essential rite of the sacrament is anointing with 
chrism. It is called <i>Confirmation</i> because it confirms and strengthens 
baptismal grace.</p>
  <p><b>267. What is the essential rite of Confirmation?</b></p>
  <p>1290-1301<BR>1318<BR>1320-1321<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The essential rite of Confirmation is the anointing with Sacred Chrism (oil 
mixed with balsam and consecrated by the bishop), which is done by the laying on 
of the hand of the minister who pronounces the sacramental words proper to the 
rite. In the West this anointing is done on the forehead of the baptized with 
the words, "Be sealed with the gift of the Holy Spirit". In the Eastern Churches 
of the Byzantine rite this anointing is also done on other parts of the body 
with the words, "The seal of the gift of the Holy Spirit".</p>
  <p><b>268. What is the effect of Confirmation?</b></p>
  <p>1302-1305<BR>1316-1317</p>
  <p>The effect of Confirmation is a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit like that 
of Pentecost. This outpouring impresses on the soul an indelible character and 
produces a growth in the grace of Baptism. It roots the recipient more deeply in 
divine sonship, binds him more firmly to Christ and to the Church and 
reinvigorates the gifts of the Holy Spirit in his soul. It gives a special 
strength to witness to the Christian faith. </p>
  <p><b>269. Who can receive this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1306-1311<BR>1319</p>
  <p>Only those already baptized can and should receive this sacrament which can be 
received only once. To receive Confirmation efficaciously the candidate must be 
in the state of grace. </p>
  <p><b>270. Who is the minister of Confirmation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1312-1314</p>
  <p>The original minister of Confirmation is the bishop. In this way the link 
between the confirmed and the Church in her apostolic dimension is made 
manifest. When a priest confers this sacrament, as ordinarily happens in the 
East and in special cases in the West, the link with the bishop and with the 
Church is expressed by the priest who is the collaborator of the bishop and by 
the Sacred Chrism, consecrated by the bishop himself. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENT OF THE EUCHARIST</font></b></p>
  <p><b>271. What is the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1322-1323<BR>1409<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>The Eucharist is the very sacrifice of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus 
which he instituted to perpetuate the sacrifice of the cross throughout the ages 
until his return in glory. Thus he entrusted to his Church this memorial of his 
death and Resurrection. It is a sign of unity, a bond of charity, a paschal 
banquet, in which Christ is consumed, the mind is filled with grace, and a 
pledge of future glory is given to us.</p>
  <p><b>272. When did Jesus Christ institute the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1323<br>
  1337-1340</p>
  <p>Jesus instituted the Eucharist on Holy Thursday "the night on which he was 
betrayed" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 11:23), as he celebrated the Last Supper with his 
apostles.</p>
  <p><b>273. How did he institute the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1337-1340<BR>1365, 1406</p>
  <p>After he had gathered with his apostles in the Cenacle, Jesus took bread in his 
hands. He broke it and gave it to them saying, "Take this and eat it, all of 
you; this is my Body which will be given up for you". Then, he took the cup of 
wine in his hands and said, "Take this and drink of this, all of you. This is 
the cup of my Blood, the Blood of the new and everlasting covenant. It will be 
shed for you and for all so that sins may be forgive. Do this in memory of me".</p>
  <p><b>274. What does the Eucharist represent in the life of the Church?</b></p>
  <p>1324-1327<BR>1407<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>It is the source and summit of all Christian life. In the Eucharist, the 
sanctifying action of God in our regard and our worship of him reach their high 
point. It contains the whole spiritual good of the Church, Christ himself, our 
Pasch. Communion with divine life and the unity of the People of God are both 
expressed and effected by the Eucharist. Through the eucharistic celebration we 
are united already with the liturgy of heaven and we have a foretaste of eternal 
life.</p>
  <p><b>275. What are the names for this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1328-1332</p>
  <p>The unfathomable richness of this sacrament is expressed in different names 
which evoke its various aspects. The most common names are: the Eucharist, Holy 
Mass, the Lord"s Supper, the Breaking of the Bread, the Eucharistic Celebration, 
the Memorial of the passion, death and Resurrection of the Lord, the Holy 
Sacrifice, the Holy and Divine Liturgy, the Sacred Mysteries, the Most Holy 
Sacrament of the Altar, and Holy Communion. </p>
  <p><b>276. Where does the Eucharist fit in the divine plan of salvation?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1333-1344</p>
  <p>The Eucharist was foreshadowed in the Old Covenant above all in the annual 
Passover meal celebrated every year by the Jews with unleavened bread to 
commemorate their hasty, liberating departure from Egypt. Jesus foretold it in 
his teaching and he instituted it when he celebrated the Last Supper with his 
apostles in a Passover meal. The Church, faithful to the command of her Lord, 
"Do this in memory of me" (<i>1 Corinthians</i> 11:24), has always celebrated the 
Eucharist, especially on Sunday, the day of the Resurrection of Jesus.</p>
  <p><b>277. How is the celebration of the Holy Eucharist carried out?</b></p>
  <p>1345-1355<BR>1408</p>
  <p>The Eucharist unfolds in two great parts which together form one, single act of 
worship. The Liturgy of the Word involves proclaiming and listening to the Word 
of God. The Liturgy of the Eucharist includes the presentation of the bread and 
wine, the prayer or the anaphora containing the words of consecration, and 
communion.</p>
  <p><b>278. Who is the minister for the celebration of the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1348<br>
  1411</p>
  <p>The celebrant of the Eucharist is a validly ordained priest (bishop or 
priest) who acts in the Person of Christ the Head and in the name of the Church.</p>
  <p><b>279. What are the essential and necessary elements for celebrating the 
Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1412</p>
  <p>The essential elements are wheat bread and grape wine.</p>
  <p><b>280. In what way is the Eucharist a <i>memorial</i> of the sacrifice of Christ?</b></p>
  <p>1362-1367</p>
  <p>The Eucharist is a <i>memorial</i> in the sense that it makes present and actual 
the sacrifice which Christ offered to the Father on the cross, once and for all 
on behalf of mankind. The sacrificial character of the Holy Eucharist is 
manifested in the very words of institution, "This is my Body which is given for 
you" and "This cup is the New Covenant in my Blood that will be shed for you" 
(Luke 22:19-20). The sacrifice of the cross and the sacrifice of the Eucharist 
are <i>one and the same sacrifice</i>. The priest and the victim are the same; 
only the manner of offering is different: in a bloody manner on the cross, in an 
unbloody manner in the Eucharist.</p>
  <p><b>281. In what way does the Church participate in the eucharistic sacrifice?</b></p>
  <p>1368-1372<BR>1414</p>
  <p>In the Eucharist the sacrifice of Christ becomes also the sacrifice of the 
members of his Body. The lives of the faithful, their praise, their suffering, 
their prayers, their work, are united to those of Christ. In as much as it is a 
sacrifice, the Eucharist is likewise offered for all the faithful, living and 
dead, in reparation for the sins of all and to obtain spiritual and temporal 
benefits from God. The Church in heaven is also united to the offering of 
Christ. </p>
  <p><b>282. How is Christ present in the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1373-1375<BR>1413</p>
  <p>Jesus Christ is present in the Eucharist in a unique and incomparable way. He is 
present in a true, real and substantial way, with his Body and his Blood, with 
his Soul and his Divinity. In the Eucharist, therefore, there is present in a 
sacramental way, that is, under the Eucharistic species of bread and wine, 
Christ whole and entire, God and Man.</p>
  <p><b>283. What is the meaning of <i>transubstantiation</i>?</b></p>
  <p>1376-1377<BR>1413&nbsp;</p>
  <p><i>Transubstantiation</i>&nbsp;means the change of the whole substance of bread into the substance of the 
Body of Christ and of the whole substance of wine into the substance of his 
Blood. This change is brought about in the eucharistic prayer through the 
efficacy of the word of Christ and by the action of the Holy Spirit. However, 
the outward characteristics of bread and wine, that is the "eucharistic 
species", remain unaltered.</p>
  <p><b>284. Does the breaking of the bread divide Christ?</b></p>
  <p>1377</p>
  <p>The breaking of the bread does not divide Christ. He is present whole and entire 
in each of the eucharistic species and in each of their parts.</p>
  <p><b>285. How long does the presence of Christ last in the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1377</p>
  <p>The presence of Christ continues in the Eucharist as long as the eucharistic 
species subsist.</p>
  <p><b>286. What kind of worship is due to the sacrament of the Eucharist?</b></p>
  <p>1378-1381<BR>1418</p>
  <p>The worship due to the sacrament of the Eucharist, whether during the 
celebration of the Mass or outside it, is the worship of <i>latria</i>, that is, 
the adoration given to God alone. The Church guards with the greatest care Hosts 
that have been consecrated. She brings them to the sick and to other persons who 
find it impossible to participate at Mass. She also presents them for the solemn 
adoration of the faithful and she bears them in processions. The Church 
encourages the faithful to make frequent visits to adore the Blessed Sacrament 
reserved in the tabernacle.</p>
  <p><b>287. Why is the Holy Eucharist the paschal banquet?</b></p>
  <p>1382-1384<BR>1391-1396</p>
  <p>The Holy Eucharist is the paschal banquet in as much as Christ sacramentally 
makes present his Passover and gives us his Body and Blood, offered as food and 
drink, uniting us to himself and to one another in his sacrifice.</p>
  <p><b>288. What is the meaning of the altar?</b></p>
  <p>1383<br>
  1410</p>
  <p>The <i>altar</i> is the symbol of Christ himself who is present both as 
sacrificial victim (the altar of the sacrifice) and as food from heaven which is 
given to us (the table of the Lord). </p>
  <p><b>289. When does the Church oblige her members to participate at Holy Mass?</b></p>
  <p>1389<br>
  1417</p>
  <p>The Church obliges the faithful to participate at Holy Mass every Sunday and on 
holy days of obligation. She recommends participation at Holy Mass on other days 
as well.</p>
  <p><b>290. When must one receive Holy Communion?</b></p>
  <p>1389</p>
  <p>The Church recommends that the faithful, if they have the required dispositions, 
receive Holy Communion whenever they participate at Holy Mass. However, the 
Church obliges them to receive Holy Communion at least once a year during the 
Easter season.</p>
  <p><b>291. What is required to receive Holy Communion?</b></p>
  <p>1385-1389<BR>1415</p>
  <p>To receive Holy Communion one must be fully incorporated into the Catholic 
Church and be in the state of grace, that is, not conscious of being in mortal 
sin. Anyone who is conscious of having committed a grave sin must first receive 
the sacrament of Reconciliation before going to Communion. Also important for 
those receiving Holy Communion are a spirit of recollection and prayer, 
observance of the fast prescribed by the Church, and an appropriate disposition 
of the body (gestures and dress) as a sign of respect for Christ.</p>
  <p><b>292. What are the fruits of Holy Communion?</b></p>
  <p>1391-1397<BR>1416</p>
  <p>Holy Communion increases our union with Christ and with his Church. It preserves 
and renews the life of grace received at Baptism and Confirmation and makes us 
grow in love for our neighbor. It strengthens us in charity, wipes away venial 
sins and preserves us from mortal sin in the future.</p>
  <p><b>293. When is it possible to give Holy Communion to other Christians?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1398-1401</p>
  <p>Catholic ministers may give Holy Communion licitly to members of the Oriental 
Churches which are not in full communion with the Catholic Church whenever they 
ask for it of their own will and possess the required dispositions. Catholic 
ministers may licitly give Holy Communion to members of other ecclesial 
communities only if, in grave necessity, they ask for it of their own will, 
possess the required dispositions, and give evidence of holding the Catholic 
faith regarding the sacrament.</p>
  <p><b>294. Why is the Eucharist a "pledge of future glory"?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1402-1405</p>
  <p>The Eucharist is a pledge of future glory because it fills us with every grace 
and heavenly blessing. It fortifies us for our pilgrimage in this life and makes 
us long for eternal life. It unites us already to Christ seated at the right 
hand of the Father, to the Church in heaven and to the Blessed Virgin and all 
the saints.</p>

  <p>1420-1421<BR>1426</p>
  <p>Christ, the physician of our soul and body, instituted these sacraments because 
the new life that he gives us in the sacraments of Christian initiation can be

  <p><b></b>1422-1424</p>
  <p>It is called the sacrament of Penance, the sacrament of Reconciliation, the 
sacrament of Forgiveness, the sacrament of Confession, and the sacrament of 
Conversion.</p>
  <p><b>297. Why is there a sacrament of Reconciliation after Baptism?</b></p>
  <p>1425-1426<BR>1484<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Since the new life of grace received in Baptism does not abolish the weakness of 
human nature nor the inclination to sin (that is, <i>concupiscence</i>), Christ 
instituted this sacrament for the conversion of the baptized who have been 
separated from him by sin.</p>
  <p><b>298. When did he institute this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1485</p>
  <p>The risen Lord instituted this sacrament on the evening of Easter when he showed 
himself to his apostles and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. If you 
forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they 
are retained." (<i>John</i> 20:22-23).</p>
  <p><b>299. Do the baptized have need of conversion?</b></p>
  <p>1427-1429</p>
  <p>The call of Christ to conversion continues to resound in the lives of the 
baptized. Conversion is a continuing obligation for the whole Church. She is 
holy but includes sinners in her midst.</p>
  <p><b>300. What is interior penance?</b></p>
  <p>1430-1433<BR>1490<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>It is the movement of a "contrite heart" (<i>Psalm</i> 51:19) drawn by divine grace to 
respond to the merciful love of God. This entails sorrow for and abhorrence of 
sins committed, a firm purpose not to sin again in the future and trust in the 
help of God. It is nourished by hope in divine mercy.</p>
  <p><b>301. What forms does penance take in the Christian life?</b></p>
  <p>1434-1439</p>
  <p>Penance can be expressed in many and various ways but above all in fasting, 
prayer, and almsgiving. These and many other forms of penance can be practiced 
in the daily life of a Christian, particularly during the time of Lent and on 
the penitential day of Friday.</p>
  <p><b>302. What are the essential elements of the sacrament of Reconciliation?</b></p>
  <p>1440-1449</p>
  <p>The essential elements are two: the acts of the penitent 
who comes to repentance through the action of the Holy Spirit, and the 
absolution of the priest who in the name of Christ grants forgiveness and 
determines the ways of making satisfaction.</p>
  <p><b>303. What are the acts of the penitent?</b></p>
  <p>1450-1460<BR>1487-1492</p>
  <p>They are: a careful <i>examination of conscience</i>; <i>contrition</i> (or 
repentance), which is perfect when it is motivated by love of God and imperfect 
if it rests on other motives and which includes the determination not to sin 
again; <i>confession</i>, which consists in the telling of one"s sins to the 
priest; and <i>satisfaction</i> or the carrying out of certain acts of penance 
which the confessor imposes upon the penitent to repair the damage caused by 
sin.</p>
  <p><b>304. Which sins must be confessed?</b></p>
  <p>1456</p>
  <p>All grave sins not yet confessed, which a careful examination of conscience 
brings to mind, must be brought to the sacrament of Penance. The confession of 
serious sins is the only ordinary way to obtain forgiveness.</p>
  <p><b>305. When is a person obliged to confess mortal sins?</b></p>
  <p>1457</p>
  <p>Each of the faithful who has reached the age of discretion is bound to confess 
his or her mortal sins at least once a year and always before receiving Holy 
Communion.</p>
  <p><b>306. Why can venial sins also be the object of sacramental confession?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1458</p>
  <p>The confession of venial sins is strongly recommended by the Church, even if 
this is not strictly necessary, because it helps us to form a correct conscience 
and to fight against evil tendencies. It allows us to be healed by Christ and to 
progress in the life of the Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>307. Who is the minister of this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1461-1466<BR>1495&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Christ has entrusted the ministry of Reconciliation to his apostles, to the 
bishops who are their successors and to the priests who are the collaborators of 
the bishops, all of whom become thereby instruments of the mercy and justice of 
God. They exercise their power of forgiving sins <i>in the name of the Father 
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit</i>.</p>
  <p><b>308. To whom is the absolution of some sins reserved?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1463</p>
  <p>The absolution of certain particularly grave sins (like those punished by 
excommunication) is reserved to the Apostolic See or to the local bishop or to 
priests who are authorized by them. Any priest, however, can absolve a person 
who is in danger of death from any sin and excommunication.</p>
  <p><b>309. Is a confessor bound to secrecy?</b></p>
  <p>1467&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Given the delicacy and greatness of this ministry and the respect due to people 
every confessor, without any exception and under very severe penalties, is bound 
to maintain "the sacramental seal" which means absolute secrecy about the sins 
revealed to him in confession.</p>
  <p><b>310. What are the effects of this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1468-1470<BR>1496&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The effects of the sacrament of Penance are: reconciliation with God and 
therefore the forgiveness of sins; reconciliation with the Church; recovery, if 
it has been lost, of the state of grace; remission of the eternal punishment 
merited by mortal sins, and remission, at least in part, of the temporal 
punishment which is the consequence of sin; peace, serenity of conscience and 
spiritual consolation; and an increase of spiritual strength for the struggle of 
Christian living.</p>
  <p><b>311. Can this sacrament be celebrated in some cases with a general confession 
and general absolution?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1480-1484</p>
  <p>In cases of serious necessity (as in imminent danger of death) recourse may be 
had to a communal celebration of Reconciliation with general confession and 
general absolution, as long as the norms of the Church are observed and there is 
the intention of individually confessing one"s grave sins in due time.</p>
  <p><b>312. What are indulgences?</b></p>
  <p>1471-1479<BR>1498<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>Indulgences are the remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins 
whose guilt has already been forgiven. The faithful Christian who is duly 
disposed gains the indulgence under prescribed conditions for either himself or 
the departed. Indulgences are granted through the ministry of the Church which, 
as the dispenser of the grace of redemption, distributes the treasury of the 
merits of Christ and the Saints. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENT OF ANOINTING OF THE SICK</font></b></p>
  <p><b>313. How was sickness viewed in the Old Testament?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1499-1502</p>
  <p>In the Old Testament sickness was experienced as a sign of weakness and at the 
same time perceived as mysteriously bound up with sin. The prophets intuited 
that sickness could also have a redemptive value for one"s own sins and those of 
others. Thus sickness was lived out in the presence of God from whom people 
implored healing.</p>
  <p><b>314. What is the significance of Jesus" compassion for the sick? </b>
  </p>
  <p><b></b>1503-1505&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The compassion of Jesus toward the sick and his many healings of the infirm were 
a clear sign that with him had come the Kingdom of God and therefore victory 
over sin, over suffering, and over death. By his own passion and death he gave 
new meaning to our suffering which, when united with his own, can become a means 
of purification and of salvation for us and for others.</p>
  <p><b>315. What is the attitude of the Church toward the sick?</b></p>
  <p>1506-1513<BR>1526-1527&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Having received from the Lord the charge to heal the sick, the Church strives to 
carry it out by taking care of the sick and accompanying them with her prayer of 
intercession. Above all, the Church possesses a sacrament specifically intended 
for the benefit of the sick. This sacrament was instituted by Christ and is 
attested by Saint James: "Is anyone among you sick? Let him call in the 
presbyters of the Church and let them pray over him and anoint him with oil in 
the name of the Lord" (<i>James</i> 5:14-15).</p>
  <p><b>316. Who can receive the sacrament of the anointing of the sick?</b></p>
  <p>1514-1515<BR>1528-1529&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Any member of the faithful can receive this sacrament as soon as he or she 
begins to be in danger of death because of sickness or old age. The faithful who 
receive this sacrament can receive it several times if their illness becomes 
worse or another serious sickness afflicts them. The celebration of this 
sacrament should, if possible, be preceded by individual confession on the part 
of the sick person.</p>
  <p><b>317. Who administers this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1516<BR>1530</p>
  <p>This sacrament can be administered only by priests (bishops or presbyters).</p>
  <p><b>318. How is this sacrament celebrated?</b></p>
  <p>1517-1519<BR>1531</p>
  <p>The celebration of this sacrament consists essentially in an <i>anointing</i> 
with oil which may be blessed by the bishop. The anointing is on the forehead 
and on the hands of the sick person (in the Roman rite) or also on other parts 
of the body (in the other rites) accompanied by the <i>prayer</i> of the priest 
who asks for the special grace of this sacrament.</p>
  <p><b>319. What are the effects of this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1520-1523<BR>1532&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This sacrament confers a special grace which unites the sick person more 
intimately to the Passion of Christ for his good and for the good of all the 
Church. It gives comfort, peace, courage, and even the forgiveness of sins if 
the sick person is not able to make a confession. Sometimes, if it is the will 
of God, this sacrament even brings about the restoration of physical health. In 
any case this Anointing prepares the sick person for the journey to the Father"s 
House.</p>
  <p><b>320. What is Viaticum?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1524-1525</p>
  <p>Viaticum is the Holy Eucharist received by those who are about to leave this 
earthly life and are preparing for the journey to eternal life. Communion in the 
body and blood of Christ who died and rose from the dead, received at the moment 
of passing from this world to the Father, is the seed of eternal life and the 
power of the resurrection.</p>

  <a name="The Sacraments at the Service of Communion and Mission">The 
  Sacraments at the Service of Communion and Mission</a></b></font></p>
  <p><b>321. What are the sacraments at the service of communion and mission?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1533-1535</p>
  <p>Two sacraments, Holy Orders and Matrimony, confer a special grace for a 
particular mission in the Church to serve and build up the People of God. These 
sacraments contribute in a special way to ecclesial communion and to the 
salvation of others. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENT OF HOLY ORDERS</font></b></p>
  <p><b>322. What is the sacrament of Holy Orders?</b></p>
  <p>1536</p>
  <p>It is the sacrament through which the mission entrusted by Christ to his 
apostles continues to be exercised in the Church until the end of time.</p>
  <p><b>323. Why is this sacrament called Holy Orders?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1537-1538</p>
  <p><i>Orders</i>&nbsp;designates an ecclesial body into which one enters by means of a special 
consecration (ordination). Through a special gift of the Holy Spirit, this 
sacrament enables the ordained to exercise a <i>sacred power</i> in the name and 
with the authority of Christ for the service of the People of God.</p>
  <p><b>324. What place does the sacrament of Holy Orders have in the divine plan of 
salvation?</b></p>
  <p>1539-1546<BR>1590-1591&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This sacrament was prefigured in the Old Covenant in the service of the Levites, 
in the priesthood of Aaron, and in the institution of the seventy "Elders" 
(<i>Numbers</i> 11:25). These prefigurations find their fulfillment in Christ Jesus who 
by the sacrifice of the cross is the "one mediator between God and man" 
(<i>1 Timothy</i> 2:5), the "High Priest according to the order of Melchizedek" 
(<i>Hebrews</i> 5:10). The one priesthood of Christ is made present in the ministerial 
priesthood.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"Only Christ is the true priest, the others being only his 
ministers."</i> (Saint Thomas Aquinas)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>325. What are the degrees that make up the sacrament of Holy Orders?</b></p>
  <p>1554<BR>1593</p>
  <p>The sacrament of Holy Orders is composed of three degrees which are 
irreplaceable for the organic structure of the Church: the episcopate, the 
presbyterate and the diaconate.</p>
  <p><b>326. What is the effect of episcopal ordination?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1557-1558</p>
  <p>Episcopal ordination confers the fullness of the sacrament of Holy Orders. It 
makes the bishop a legitimate successor of the apostles and integrates him into 
the episcopal college to share with the Pope and the other bishops care for all 
the churches. It confers on him the offices of teaching, sanctifying, and 
ruling.</p>
  <p><b>327. What is the office confided to a Bishop in a particular Church?</b></p>
  <p>1560-1561</p>
  <p>The<b> </b>bishop to whom the care of a particular Church is entrusted is the 
visible head and foundation of unity for that Church. For the sake of that 
Church, as vicar of Christ, he fulfills the office of shepherd and is assisted 
by his own priests and deacons. </p>
  <p><b>328. What is the effect of ordination to the priesthood?</b></p>
  <p>1562-1567<BR>1595&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The anointing of the Spirit seals the priest with an indelible, spiritual 
character that configures him to Christ the priest and enables him to act in the 
name of Christ the Head. As a co-worker of the order of bishops he is 
consecrated to preach the Gospel, to celebrate divine worship, especially the 
Eucharist from which his ministry draws its strength, and to be a shepherd of 
the faithful.</p>
  <p><b>329. How does a priest carry out his proper ministry?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1568</p>
  <p>A priest, although ordained for a universal mission, exercises his ministry in a 
particular Church. This ministry is pursued in sacramental brotherhood with 
other priests who form the "presbyterate". In communion with the bishop, and 
depending upon him, they bear responsibility for the particular Church.</p>
  <p><b>330. What is the effect of the ordination to the diaconate?</b></p>
  <p>1569-1571<BR>1596</p>
  <p>The deacon, configured to Christ the servant of all, is ordained for service to 
the Church. He carries out this service under the authority of his proper bishop 
by the ministry of the Word, of divine worship, of pastoral care and of charity.</p>
  <p><b>331. How is the sacrament of Holy Orders celebrated?</b></p>
  <p>1572-1574<BR>1597&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The sacrament of Holy Orders is conferred, in each of its three degrees, by 
means of the <i>imposition of hands</i> on the head of the ordinand by the 
Bishop who pronounces the solemn <i>prayer</i> of consecration. With this prayer 
he asks God on behalf of the ordinand for the special outpouring of the Holy 
Spirit and for the gifts of the Spirit proper to the ministry to which he is 
being ordained.</p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p><b>332. Who can confer this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1575-1576<BR>1600</p>
  <p>Only validly ordained bishops, as successors of the apostles, can confer the 
sacrament of Holy Orders.</p>
  <p><b>333. Who can receive this sacrament?</b></p>
  <p>1577-1578<BR>1598&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This sacrament can only be validly received by a baptized man. 
The Church recognizes herself as bound by this choice made by the Lord Himself. 
No one can demand to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders, but must be judged 
suitable for the ministry by the authorities of the Church. </p>
  <p><b>334. Is it necessary to be celibate to receive the sacrament of Holy Orders?</b></p>
  <p>1579-1580<BR>1599</p>
  <p>It is always necessary to be celibate for the episcopacy. For the priesthood in 
the Latin Church men who are practicing Catholics and celibate are chosen, men 
who intend to continue to live a celibate life "for the kingdom of heaven" 
(<i>Matthew</i> 19:12). In the Eastern Churches marriage is not permitted after one has 
been ordained. Married men can be ordained to the permanent diaconate. </p>
  <p><b>335. What are the effects of the sacrament of Holy Orders?</b></p>
  <p>1581-1589</p>
  <p>This sacrament yields a special outpouring of the Holy Spirit which configures 
the recipient to Christ in his triple office as Priest, Prophet, and King, 
according to the respective degrees of the sacrament. Ordination confers an 
indelible spiritual character and therefore cannot be repeated or conferred for 
a limited time.</p>
  <p><b>336. With what authority is the priestly ministry exercised?</b></p>
  <p>1547-1553<BR>1592<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Ordained priests in the exercise of their sacred ministry speak and act not on 
their own authority, nor even by mandate or delegation of the community, but 
rather in the Person of Christ the Head and in the name of the Church. 
Therefore, the ministerial priesthood differs essentially and not just in degree 
from the priesthood common to all the faithful for whose service Christ 
instituted it. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENT OF MATRIMONY</font></b></p>
  <p><b>337. What is the plan of God regarding man 
and woman?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1601-1605</p>
  <p>God who is love and who created man 
and woman for love has called them to love. By creating man 
and woman he called them to an intimate communion of life and of love in 
marriage: "So that they are no longer two, but one flesh" (<i>Matthew</i> 19:6). God 
said to them in blessing "Be fruitful and multiply" (<i>Genesis</i> 1:28).</p>
  <p><b>338. For what ends has God instituted Matrimony?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1659-1660</p>
  <p>The marital union of man 
and woman, which is founded and endowed with its own proper laws by the Creator, 
is by its very nature ordered to the communion and good of the couple and to the 
generation and education of children. According to the original divine plan this 
conjugal union is indissoluble, as Jesus Christ affirmed: "What God has joined 
together, let no man 
put asunder" (<i>Mark</i> 10:9).</p>
  <p><b>339. How does sin threaten marriage?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1606-1608&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Because of original sin, which caused a rupture in the God-given communion 
between man 
and woman, the union of marriage is very often threatened by discord and 
infidelity. However, God in his infinite mercy gives to man 
and woman the grace to bring the union of their lives into accord with the 
original divine plan.</p>
  <p><b>340. What does the Old Testament teach about marriage?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1609-1611</p>
  <p>God helped his people above all through the teaching of the Law and the Prophets 
to deepen progressively their understanding of the unity and indissolubility of 
marriage. The nuptial covenant of God with Israel prepared for and prefigured 
the new covenant established by Jesus Christ the Son of God, with his spouse, 
the Church.</p>
  <p><b>341. What new element did Christ give to Matrimony?</b></p>
  <p>1612-1617<BR>1661&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Christ not only restored the original order of matrimony but raised it to the 
dignity of a sacrament, giving spouses a special grace to live out their 
marriage as a symbol of Christ"s love for his bride the Church:&nbsp;"Husbands, love your wives as Christ loves the Church" (<i>Ephesians</i> 5:25).</p>
  <p><b>342. Are all obliged to get married?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1618-1620</p>
  <p>Matrimony is not an obligation for everyone, especially since God calls some men 
and women to follow the Lord Jesus in a life of virginity or of celibacy for the 
sake of the  Kingdom&nbsp;of  Heaven. These renounce the great good of Matrimony to concentrate on the things 
of the Lord and seek to please him. They become a sign of the absolute supremacy 
of Christ"s love and of the ardent expectation of his glorious return.</p>
  <p><b>343. How is the sacrament of Matrimony celebrated?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1621-1624</p>
  <p>Since Matrimony establishes spouses in a public state of life in the Church, its 
liturgical celebration is public, taking place in the presence of a priest (or 
of a witness authorized by the Church) and other witnesses.</p>
  <p><b>344. What is matrimonial consent?</b></p>
  <p>1625-1632<BR>1662-1663&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Matrimonial consent is given when a man 
and a woman manifest the will to give themselves to each other irrevocably in 
order to live a covenant of faithful and fruitful love. Since consent 
constitutes Matrimony, it is indispensable and irreplaceable. For a valid 
marriage the consent must have as its object true Matrimony, and be a human act 
which is conscious and free and not determined by duress or coercion. </p>
  <p><b>345. What is required when one of the spouses is not a Catholic?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1633-1637&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A <i>mixed</i> marriage (between a Catholic and a baptized non-Catholic) needs 
for liceity the permission<i> </i>of ecclesiastical authority. In a case of <i>
disparity of cult</i> (between a Catholic and a non-baptized person) a 
dispensation is required for validity. In both cases, it is essential that the 
spouses do not exclude the acceptance of the essential ends and properties of 
marriage. It is also necessary for the Catholic party to accept the obligation, 
of which the non-Catholic party has been advised, to persevere in the faith and 
to assure the baptism and Catholic education of their children.</p>
  <p><b>346. What are the effects of the sacrament of Matrimony?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1638-1642</p>
  <p>The sacrament of Matrimony establishes a perpetual and exclusive <i>bond</i> 
between the spouses. God himself seals the consent of the spouses. Therefore, a 
marriage which is ratified and consummated between baptized persons can never be 
dissolved. Furthermore, this sacrament bestows upon the spouses the grace 
necessary to attain holiness in their married life and to accept responsibly the 
gift of children and provide for their education.</p>
  <p><b>347. What sins are gravely opposed to the sacrament of Matrimony?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1645-1648</p>
  <p>Adultery and polygamy are opposed to the sacrament of matrimony because they 
contradict the equal dignity of man 
and woman and the unity and exclusivity of married love. Other sins include the 
deliberate refusal of one"s procreative potential which deprives conjugal love 
of the gift of children and divorce which goes against the indissolubility of 
marriage.</p>
  <p><b>348. When does the Church allow the physical separation of spouses?</b></p>
  <p>1629<BR>1649&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Church permits the physical separation of spouses when for serious reasons 
their living together becomes practically impossible, even though there may be 
hope for their reconciliation. As long as one"s spouse lives, however, one is 
not free to contract a new union, except if the marriage be null and be declared 
so by ecclesiastical authority.</p>
  <p><b>349. What is the attitude of the Church toward those people who are divorced and 
then remarried?</b></p>
  <p>1650-1651<BR>1665&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Church, since she is faithful to her Lord, cannot recognize the union of 
people who are civilly divorced and remarried. "Whoever divorces his wife and 
marries another, commits adultery against her; and if she divorces her husband 
and marries another, she commits adultery" (<i>Mark</i> 10:11-12). The Church manifests 
an attentive solicitude toward such people and encourages them to a life of 
faith, prayer, works of charity and the Christian education of their children. 
However, they cannot receive sacramental absolution, take Holy Communion, or 
exercise certain ecclesial responsibilities as long as their situation, which 
objectively contravenes God&#39;s law, persists.</p>
  <p><b>350. Why is the Christian family called a <i>domestic church</i>?</b></p>
  <p>1655-1658<BR>1666&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Christian family is called the domestic church because the family manifests 
and lives out the communal and familial nature of the Church as the family of 
God. Each family member, in accord with their own role, exercises the baptismal 
priesthood and contributes toward making the family a community of grace and of 
prayer, a school of human and Christian virtue and the place where the faith is 
first proclaimed to children.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SACRAMENTALS</font></b></p>
  <p><b>351. What are the sacramentals?</b></p>
  <p>1667-1672<BR>1677-1678&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These are sacred signs instituted by the Church to sanctify different 
circumstances of life. They include a prayer accompanied by the sign of the 
cross and other signs. Among the sacramentals which occupy an important place 
are: blessings, which are the praise of God and a prayer to obtain his gifts, 
the consecration of persons and the dedication of things for the worship of God.</p>
  <p><b>352. What is an exorcism?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1673&nbsp;</p>
  <p>When the Church asks with its authority in the name of Jesus that a person or 
object be protected against the power of the Evil One and withdrawn from his 
dominion, it is called an exorcism. This is done in ordinary form in the rite of

only by a priest authorized by the bishop.</p>
  <p><b>353. What forms of popular piety accompany the sacramental life of the Church?</b></p>
  <p>1674-1676<BR>1679</p>
  <p>The religious sense of the Christian people has always found expression in the 
various forms of piety which accompany the sacramental life of the Church such 
as the veneration of relics, visits to sanctuaries, pilgrimages, processions, 
the stations of the cross and the rosary. The Church sheds the light of faith 
upon and fosters authentic forms of popular piety.</p>

  <p><b>354. What is the relationship between the sacraments and the death of a 
Christian?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1680-1683</p>
  <p>The Christian who dies in Christ reaches at the end of his earthly existence the 
fulfillment of that new life which was begun in Baptism, strengthened in 
Confirmation, and nourished in the Eucharist, the foretaste of the heavenly 
banquet. The meaning of the death of a Christian becomes clear in the light of 
the death and Resurrection of Christ our only hope. The Christian who dies in 
Christ Jesus goes "away from the body to be at home with the Lord" (<i>2 
Corinthians</i> 5:8).</p>
  <p><b>355. What do funeral rites express?</b></p>
  <p>1684-1685&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although celebrated in different rites in keeping with the situations and 
traditions of various regions, funerals express the paschal character of 
Christian death in hope of the resurrection. They also manifest the meaning of 
communion with the departed particularly through prayer for the purification of 
their souls.</p>
  <p><b>356. What are the main moments in funerals? </b></p>
  <p><b></b>1686-1690&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Usually, funeral rites consist of four principal parts: welcoming the body of 
the deceased by the community with words of comfort and hope, the liturgy of the 
Word, the Eucharistic Sacrifice, and the farewell in which the soul of the 
departed is entrusted to God, the Source of eternal life, while the body is 
buried in the hope of the resurrection.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">MAN THE IMAGE OF GOD</font></b></p>
  <p><b>358. What is the root of human dignity?</b></p>
  <p>1699-1715</p>
  <p>The dignity of the human person is rooted in his or her creation in the image 
and likeness of God. Endowed with a spiritual and immortal soul, intelligence 
and free will, the human person is ordered to God and called in soul and in body 
to eternal beatitude. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">OUR VOCATION TO BEATITUDE</font></b></p>
  <p><b>359. How do we attain beatitude?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1716&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We&nbsp;attain beatitude by virtue of the grace of Christ which makes us 
participants in the divine life. Christ in the Gospel points out to his 
followers the way that leads to eternal happiness: the beatitudes. The grace of 
Christ also is operative in every person who, following a correct conscience, 
seeks and loves the true and the good and avoids evil.</p>
  <p><b>360. Why are the beatitudes important for us?</b></p>
  <p>1716-1717<br>
  1725-1726</p>
  <p>The beatitudes are at the heart of Jesus" preaching and they take up and fulfill 
the promises that God made starting with Abraham. They depict the very 
countenance of Jesus and they characterize authentic Christian life. They reveal 
the ultimate goal of human activity, which is eternal happiness.</p>
  <p><b>361. What is the relationship between the beatitudes and our desire for 
happiness?</b></p>
  <p>1718-1719</p>
  <p>The beatitudes respond to the innate desire for happiness that God has placed in 
the human heart in order to draw us to himself. God alone can satisfy this 
desire.</p>
  <p><b>362. What is eternal happiness?</b></p>
  <p>1720-1724<BR>1727-1729</p>
  <p>It is the vision of God in eternal life in which we are fully "partakers of the 
divine nature" (2 Peter 1:4), of the glory of Christ and of the joy of the 
trinitarian life. This happiness surpasses human capabilities. It is a 
supernatural and gratuitous gift of God just as is the grace which leads to it. 
This promised happiness confronts us with decisive moral choices concerning 
earthly goods and urges us to love God above all things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">MAN&#39;S FREEDOM</font></b></p>
  <p><b>363. What is freedom?</b></p>
  <p>1730-1733<BR>1743-1744&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Freedom is the power given by God to act or not to act, to do this or to do 
that, and so to perform deliberate actions on one&#39;s own responsibility. Freedom 
characterizes properly human acts. The more one does what is good, the freer one 
becomes. Freedom attains its proper perfection when it is directed toward God, 
the highest good and our beatitude. Freedom implies also the possibility of 
choosing between good and evil. The choice of evil is an abuse of freedom and 
leads to the slavery of sin.</p>
  <p><b>364. What is the relationship between freedom and responsibility?</b></p>
  <p>1734-1737<BR>1745-1746</p>
  <p>Freedom makes people responsible for their actions to the extent that they are 
voluntary, even if the imputability and responsibility for an action can be 
diminished or sometimes cancelled by ignorance, inadvertence, duress, fear, 
inordinate attachments, or habit.</p>
  <p><b>365. Why does everyone have a right to exercise freedom?</b></p>
  <p>1738<BR>1747&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The right to the exercise of freedom belongs to everyone because it is 
inseparable from his or her dignity as a human person. Therefore this right must 
always be respected, especially in moral and religious matters, and it must be 
recognized and protected by civil authority within the limits of the common good 
and a just public order.</p>
  <p><b>366. What place does human freedom have in the plan of salvation?</b></p>
  <p>1739-1742<BR>1748&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Our freedom is weakened because of original sin. This weakness is intensified 
because of successive sins. Christ, however, set us free "so that we should 
remain free" (<i>Galatians</i> 5:1). With his grace, the Holy Spirit leads us to 
spiritual freedom to make us free co-workers with him in the Church and in the 
world.</p>
  <p><b>367. What are the sources of the morality of human acts?</b></p>
  <p>1749-1754<BR>1757-1758</p>
  <p>The morality of human acts depends on three sources: <i>the object chosen</i>, 
either a true or apparent good; <i>the intention</i> of the subject who acts, 
that is, the purpose for which the subject performs the act; and <i>the 
circumstances</i> of the act, which include its consequences.</p>
  <p><b>368. When is an act morally good?</b></p>
  <p>1755-1756<BR>1759-1760</p>
  <p>An act is morally good when it assumes simultaneously the goodness of the 
object, of the end, and of the circumstances. A chosen object can by itself 
vitiate an act in its entirety, even if the intention is good. It is not licit 
to do evil so that good may result from it. An evil end corrupts the action, 
even if the object is good in itself. On the other hand, a good end does not 
make an act good if the object of that act is evil, since the end does not 
justify the means. Circumstances can increase or diminish the responsibility of 
the one who is acting but they cannot change the moral quality of the acts 
themselves. They never make good an act which is in itself evil.</p>
  <p><b>369. Are there acts which are always illicit?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1756<br>
  1761</p>
  <p>There are some acts which, in and of themselves, are always illicit by reason of 
their object (for example, blasphemy, homicide, adultery). Choosing such acts 
entails a disorder of the will, that is, a moral evil which can never be 
justified by appealing to the good effects which could possibly result from 
them. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE MORALITY OF THE PASSIONS</font></b></p>
  <p><b>370. What are the passions?</b></p>
  <p>1762-1766<BR>1771-1772<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The passions are the feelings, the emotions or the movements of the sensible 
appetite - natural components of human psychology - which incline a person to 
act or not to act in view of what is perceived as good or evil. The principal 
passions are love and hatred, desire and fear, joy, sadness, and anger. The 
chief passion is love which is drawn by the attraction of the good. One can only 
love what is good, real or apparent.</p>
  <p><b>371. Are the passions morally good or bad?</b></p>
  <p>1767-1770<BR>1773-1775</p>
  <p>The passions insofar as they are movements of the sensible appetite are neither 
good nor bad in themselves. They are good when they contribute to a good action 
and they are evil in the opposite case. They can be taken up into the virtues or 
perverted by the vices. </p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE MORAL CONSCIENCE</font></b></p>
  <p><b>372. What is the moral conscience?</b></p>
  <p>1776-1780<br>
  1795-1797</p>
  <p>Moral conscience, present in the heart of the person, is a judgment of reason 
which at the appropriate moment enjoins him to do good and to avoid evil. Thanks 
to moral conscience, the human person perceives the moral quality of an act to 
be done or which has already been done, permitting him to assume responsibility 
for the act. When attentive to moral conscience, the prudent person can hear the 
voice of God who speaks to him or her.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>373. What does the dignity of the human person imply for the moral conscience?</b></p>
  <p>1780-1782<BR>1798</p>
  <p>The dignity of a human person requires the uprightness of a moral conscience 
(which is to say that it be in accord with what is just and good according to 
reason and the law of God). Because of this personal dignity, no one may be 
forced to act contrary to conscience; nor, within the limits of the common good, 
be prevented from acting according to it, especially in religious matters.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>374. How is a moral conscience formed to be upright and truthful?</b></p>
  <p>1783-1788<BR>1799-1800&nbsp;</p>
  <p>An upright and true moral conscience is formed by education and by assimilating 
the Word of God and the teaching of the Church. It is supported by the gifts of 
the Holy Spirit and helped by the advice of wise people. Prayer and an 
examination of conscience can also greatly assist one"s moral formation.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>375. What norms must conscience always follow?</b></p>
  <p align="left">1789</p>
  <p>There are three general norms: 1) one may never do evil so that good may result 
from it; 2) the so-called <i>Golden Rule</i>, "Whatever you wish that men would 
do to you, do so to them" (<i>Matthew</i> 7:12); 3) charity always proceeds by way of 
respect for one"s neighbor and his conscience, even though this does not mean 
accepting as good something that is objectively evil.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>376. Can a moral conscience make erroneous judgments?</b></p>
  <p>1790-1794<BR>1801-1802</p>
  <p>A person must always obey the certain judgment of his own conscience but he 
could make erroneous judgments for reasons that may not always exempt him from 
personal guilt. However, an evil act committed through involuntary ignorance is 
not imputable to the person, even though the act remains objectively evil. One 
must therefore work to correct the errors of moral conscience.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE VIRTUES</font></b></p>
  <p align="left"><b>377. What is a virtue?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1803<BR>1833</p>
  <p>A virtue is an habitual and firm disposition to do the good. "The goal of a 
virtuous life is to become like God" (Saint Gregory of Nyssa). There are human 
virtues and theological virtues.</p>
  <p><b>378. What are the human virtues?</b></p>
  <p>1804<BR>1810-1811<BR>1834<BR>1839&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The human virtues are habitual and stable perfections of the intellect and will 
that govern our actions, order our passions and guide our conduct according to 
reason and faith. They are acquired and strengthened by the repetition of 
morally good acts and they are purified and elevated by divine grace.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>379. What are the principal human virtues?</b></p>
  <p>1805<BR>1834</p>
  <p>The principal human virtues are called the <i>cardinal</i> virtues, under which 
all the other virtues are grouped and which are the hinges of a virtuous life. 
The cardinal virtues are: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>380. What is prudence?</b></p>
  <p>1806<BR>1835</p>
  <p>Prudence disposes reason to discern in every circumstance our true good and to 
choose the right means for achieving it. Prudence guides the other virtues by 
pointing out their rule and measure.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>381. What is justice?</b></p>
  <p align="left">1807<BR>1836</p>
  <p>Justice consists in the firm and constant will to give to others their due. 
Justice toward God is called "the virtue of religion."</p>
  <p align="left"><b>382. What is fortitude?</b></p>
  <p align="left">1808<BR>1837</p>
  <p>Fortitude assures firmness in difficulties and constancy in the pursuit of the 
good. It reaches even to the ability of possibly sacrificing one"s own life for 
a just cause.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>383. What is temperance?</b></p>
  <p align="left">1809<BR>1838</p>
  <p>Temperance moderates the attraction of pleasures, assures the mastery of the 
will over instincts and provides balance in the use of created goods.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>384. What are the theological virtues?</b></p>
  <p>1812-1813<BR>1840-1841&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The theological virtues have God himself as their origin, motive and direct 
object. Infused with sanctifying grace, they bestow on one the capacity to live 
in a relationship with the Trinity. They are the foundation and the energizing 
force of the Christian"s moral activity and they give life to the human virtues. 
They are the pledge of the presence and action of the Holy Spirit in the 
faculties of the human being. </p>
  <p><b>385. What are the theological virtues?</b></p>
  <p>1813</p>
  <p>The theological virtues are faith, hope, and charity.</p>
  <p><b>386. What is the virtue of faith?</b></p>
  <p>1814-1816<BR>1842</p>
  <p>Faith is the theological virtue by which we believe in God and all that he has 
revealed to us and that the Church proposes for our belief because God is Truth 
itself. By faith the human person freely commits himself to God. Therefore, the 
believer seeks to know and do the will of God because "faith works through 
charity" (<i>Galatians</i> 5:6).</p>
  <p><b>387. What is hope?</b></p>
  <p>1817-1821<BR>1843&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Hope is the theological virtue by which we desire and await from God eternal 
life as our happiness, placing our trust in Christ&#39;s promises and relying on the 
help of the grace of the Holy Spirit to merit it and to persevere to the end of 
our earthly life.</p>
  <p><b>388. What is charity?</b></p>
  <p>1822-1829<BR>1844</p>
  <p>Charity is the theological virtue by which we love God above all things and our 
neighbor as ourselves for the love of God. Jesus makes charity the new 
commandment, the fullness of the law. "It is the bond of perfection" (<i>Colossians</i> 
3:14) and the foundation of the other virtues to which it gives life, 
inspiration, and order. Without charity "I am nothing" and "I gain nothing" (<i>1 
Corinthians</i> 13:1-3).</p>
  <p><b>389. What are the gifts of the Holy Spirit?</b></p>
  <p>1830-1831<BR>1845&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The gifts of the Holy Spirit are permanent dispositions which make us docile in 
following divine inspirations. They are seven: wisdom, understanding, counsel, 
fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the Lord. </p>
  <p><b>390. What are the fruits of the Holy Spirit?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1832&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <i>fruits</i> of the Holy Spirit are perfections formed in us as the first 
fruits of eternal glory. The tradition of the Church lists twelve of them: 
charity, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, generosity, gentleness, 
faithfulness, modesty, self-control, and chastity (<i>Galatians</i> 5:22-23, Vulgate).</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">SIN</font></b></p>
  <p><b>391. What does the acceptance of God"s mercy require from us?</b></p>
  <p>1846-1848<BR>1870</p>
  <p>It requires that we admit our faults and repent of our sins. God himself by his 
Word and his Spirit lays bare our sins and gives us the truth of conscience and 
the hope of forgiveness.</p>
  <p><b>392. What is sin?</b></p>
  <p>1849-1851<BR>1871-1872</p>
  <p>Sin is "a word, an act, or a desire contrary to the eternal Law" (Saint 
Augustine). It is an offense against God in disobedience to his love. It wounds human 
nature and injures human solidarity. Christ in his passion fully revealed the 
seriousness of sin and overcame it with his mercy.</p>
  <p><b>393. Is there a variety of sins?</b></p>
  <p>1852-1853<BR>1873&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are a great many kinds of sins. They can be distinguished according to 
their object or according to the virtues or commandments which they violate. 
They can directly concern God, neighbor, or ourselves. They can also be divided 
into sins of thought, of word, of deed, or of omission.</p>
  <p><b>394. How are sins distinguished according to their gravity?</b></p>
  <p>1854</p>
  <p>A distinction is made between mortal and venial sin.</p>
  <p><b>395. When does one commit a mortal sin?</b></p>
  <p>1855-1861<BR>1874&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One commits a mortal sin when there are simultaneously present: grave matter, 
full knowledge, and deliberate consent. This sin destroys charity in us, 
deprives us of sanctifying grace, and, if unrepented, leads us to the eternal 
death of hell. It can be forgiven in the ordinary way by means of the sacraments 
of Baptism and of Penance or Reconciliation.</p>
  <p><b>396. When does one commit a venial sin? </b></p>
  <p>1862-1864<BR>1875&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One commits a venial sin, which is essentially different from a mortal sin, when 
the matter involved is less serious or, even if it is grave, when full knowledge 
or complete consent are absent. Venial sin does not break the covenant with God 
but it weakens charity and manifests a disordered affection for created goods. 
It impedes the progress of a soul in the exercise of the virtues and in the 
practice of moral good. It merits temporal punishment which purifies.</p>
  <p><b>397. How does sin proliferate?</b></p>
  <p>1865<BR>1876</p>
  <p>Sin creates a proclivity to sin ; it engenders vice by repetition of the same 
acts.</p>
  <p><b>398. What are vices?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>1866-1867</p>
  <p>Vices are the opposite of virtues. They are perverse habits which darken the 
conscience and incline one to evil. The vices can be linked to the seven, 
so-called, <i>capital</i> sins which are: pride, avarice, envy, anger, lust, 
gluttony, and sloth or acedia.</p>
  <p><b>399. Do we have any responsibility for sins committed by others?</b></p>
  <p>1868</p>
  <p>We do have such a responsibility when we culpably cooperate with them. </p>
  <p><b>400. What are <i>structures</i> of sin?</b></p>
  <p>1869</p>
  <p><i>Structures</i>&nbsp;of sin are social situations or institutions that are contrary to the 
divine law. They are the expression and effect of personal sins.</p>

  <p>1877-1880<BR>1890-1891<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>Together with the personal call to beatitude, the human person has a communal 
dimension as an essential component of his nature and vocation. Indeed, all are 
called to the same end, God himself. There is a certain resemblance between the 
communion of the divine Persons and the fraternity that people are to establish 
among themselves in truth and love. Love of neighbor is inseparable from love 
for God.</p>
  <p><b>402. What is the relationship between the person and society?</b></p>
  <p>1881-1882<BR>1892-1893</p>
  <p>The human <i>person</i> is and ought to be the principle, the subject and the 
end of all social institutions. Certain societies, such as the family and the 
civic community, are necessary for the human person. Also helpful are other 
associations on the national and international levels with due respect for the 
principle of <i>subsidiarity</i>. </p>
  <p><b>403. What is the principle of subsidiarity?</b></p>
  <p>1883-1885<BR>1894</p>
  <p>The principle of subsidiarity states that a community of a higher order should 
not assume the task belonging to a community of a lower order and deprive it of 
its authority. It should rather support it in case of need.</p>
  <p><b>404. What else is required for an authentic human society?</b></p>
  <p>1886-1889<BR>1895-1896</p>
  <p>Authentic human society&nbsp;requires respect for justice, a just hierarchy of values, and the 
subordination of material and instinctual dimensions to interior and spiritual 
ones. In particular, where sin has perverted the social climate, it is necessary 
to call for the conversion of hearts and for the grace of God to obtain social 
changes that may really serve each person and the whole person. Charity, which 
requires and makes possible the practice of justice, is the greatest social 
commandment.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL LIFE</font></b></p>
  <p><b>405. What is the foundation of the authority of society?</b></p>
  <p>1897-1902<BR>1918-1920</p>
  <p>Every human community needs a legitimate authority that preserves order and 
contributes to the realization of the common good. The foundation of such 
authority lies in human nature because it corresponds to the order established 
by God.</p>
  <p><b>406. When is authority exercised in a legitimate way?</b></p>
  <p>1901-1904<BR>1921-1922</p>
  <p>Authority is exercised legitimately when it acts for the common good and employs 
morally licit means to attain it. Therefore, political regimes must be 
determined by the free decision of their citizens. They should respect the 
principle of the "rule of law" in which the law, and not the arbitrary will of 
some, is sovereign. Unjust laws and measures contrary to the moral order are not 
binding in conscience.</p>
  <p><b>407. What is the common good?</b></p>
  <p>1905-1906<BR>1924</p>
  <p>By the common good is meant the sum total of those conditions of social life 
which allow people as groups and as individuals to reach their proper 
fulfillment.</p>
  <p><b>408. What is involved in the common good?</b></p>
  <p>1907-1909<BR>1925</p>
  <p>The common good involves: respect for and promotion of the fundamental rights of 
the person, the development of the spiritual and temporal goods of persons and 
society, and the peace and security of all.</p>
  <p><b>409. Where can one find the most complete realization of the common good?</b></p>
  <p>1910-1912<BR>1927<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The most complete realization of the common good is found in those political 
communities which defend and promote the good of their citizens and of 
intermediate groups without forgetting the universal good of the entire human 
family.</p>
  <p><b>410. How does one participate in bringing about the common good?</b></p>
  <p>1913-1917<BR>1926&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All men and women according to the place and role that they occupy participate 
in promoting the common good by respecting just laws and taking charge of the 
areas for which they have personal responsibility such as the care of their own 
family and the commitment to their own work. Citizens also should take an active 
part in public life as far as possible.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">SOCIAL JUSTICE</font></b></p>
  <p><b>411. How does society ensure social justice?</b></p>
  <p>1928-1933<BR>1943-1944</p>
  <p>Society ensures social justice when it respects the dignity and the rights of 
the person as the proper end of society itself. Furthermore, society pursues 
social justice, which is linked to the common good and to the exercise of 
authority, when it provides the conditions that allow associations and 
individuals to obtain what is their due. </p>
  <p><b>412. On what is human equality based?</b></p>
  <p>1934-1935<BR>1945&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All persons&nbsp;enjoy equal dignity and fundamental rights insofar as they are created in 
the image of the one God, are endowed with the same rational soul, have the same 
nature and origin, and are called in Christ, the one and only Savior, to the 
same divine beatitude.</p>
  <p><b>413. How are we to view social inequalities?</b></p>
  <p>1936-1938<BR>1946-1947&nbsp;</p>
  <p>There are sinful social and economic inequalities which affect millions of human 
beings. These inequalities are in open contradiction to the Gospel and are 
contrary to justice, to the dignity of persons, and to peace. There are , 
however, differences among people caused by various factors which enter into the 
plan of God. Indeed, God wills that each might receive what he or she needs from 
others and that those endowed with particular talents should share them with 
others. Such differences encourage and often oblige people to the practice of 
generosity, kindness and the sharing of goods. They also foster the mutual 
enrichment of cultures.</p>
  <p><b>414. How is human solidarity manifested?</b></p>
  <p>1939-1942<BR>1948<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>Solidarity, which springs from human and Christian brotherhood, is manifested in 
the first place by the just distribution of goods, by a fair remuneration for 
work and by zeal for a more just social order. The <i>virtue</i> of solidarity 
also practices the sharing of the spiritual goods of faith which is even more 
important than sharing material goods.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE MORAL LAW</font></b></p>
  <p><b>415. What is the moral law?</b></p>
  <p>1950-1953<BR>1975-1978&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The moral law is a work of divine Wisdom. It prescribes the ways and the rules 
of conduct that lead to the promised beatitude and it forbids the ways that turn 
away from God.</p>
  <p><b>416. In what does the natural moral law consist?</b></p>
  <p>1954-1960<BR>1978-1979</p>
  <p>The natural law which is inscribed by the Creator on the heart of every person 
consists in a participation in the wisdom and the goodness of God. It expresses 
that original moral sense which enables one to discern by reason the good and 
the bad. It is universal and immutable and determines the basis of the duties 
and fundamental rights of the person as well as those of the human community and 
civil law.</p>
  <p><b>417. Is such a law perceived by everyone?</b></p>
  <p>1960</p>
  <p>Because of sin the natural law is not always perceived nor is it recognized by 
everyone with equal clarity and immediacy.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"> <i>For this reason God "wrote on the tables of the Law what men did 
not read in their hearts."</i> (Saint Augustine)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>418. What is the relationship between the natural law and the Old Law?</b></p>
  <p>1961-1962<BR>1980<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>The Old Law is the first stage of revealed Law. It expresses many truths 
naturally accessible to reason and which are thus affirmed and authenticated in 
the covenant of salvation. Its moral prescriptions, which are summed up in the 
Ten Commandments of the Decalogue, lay the foundations of the human vocation, 
prohibit what is contrary to the love of God and neighbor, and prescribe what is 
essential to it.</p>
  <p><b>419. What place does the Old Law have in the plan of salvation?</b></p>
  <p>1963-1964<BR>1982&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Old Law permitted one to know many truths which are accessible to reason, 
showed what must or must not be done and, above all, like a wise tutor, prepared 
and disposed one for conversion and for the acceptance of the Gospel. However, 
while being holy, spiritual, and good, the Old Law was still imperfect because 
in itself it did not give the strength and the grace of the Spirit for its 
observance.</p>
  <p><b>420. What is the New Law or the Law of the Gospel?</b></p>
  <p>1965-1972<BR>1983-1985&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The New Law or the Law of the Gospel, proclaimed and fulfilled by Christ, is the 
fullness and completion of the divine law, natural and revealed. It is summed up 
in the commandment to love God and neighbor and to love one another as Christ 
loved us. It is also an interior reality: the grace of the Holy Spirit which 
makes possible such love. It is "the law of freedom" (<i>Galatians</i> 1:25) because it 
inclines us to act spontaneously by the prompting of charity.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"The New Law is mainly the same grace of the Holy Spirit which is 
given to believers in Christ." </i>(Saint Thomas Aquinas)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>421. Where does one find the New Law?</b></p>
  <p>1971-1974<BR>1986</p>
  <p>The New Law is found in the entire life and preaching of Christ and in the moral 
catechesis of the apostles. The Sermon on the Mount is its principal expression.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">GRACE AND JUSTIFICATION</font></b></p>
  <p><b>422. What is justification?</b></p>
  <p>1987-1995<BR>2017-2020&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Justification is the most excellent work of God&#39;s love. It is the merciful and 
freely-given act of God which takes away our sins and makes us just and holy in 
our whole being. It is brought about by means of the grace of the Holy Spirit 
which has been merited for us by the passion of Christ and is given to us in 
Baptism. Justification is the beginning of the free response of man, that is, 
faith in Christ and of cooperation with the grace of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>423. What is the grace that justifies?</b></p>
  <p>1996-1998<BR>2005<BR>2021&nbsp;</p>
  <p>That grace is the gratuitous gift that God gives us to make us participants in 
his trinitarian life and able to act by his love. It is called <i>habitual, 
sanctifying or deifying grace</i> because it sanctifies and divinizes us. It is
<i>supernatural</i> because it depends entirely on God"s gratuitous initiative 
and surpasses the abilities of the intellect and the powers of human beings. It 
therefore escapes our experience.</p>
  <p><b>424. What other kinds of grace are there?</b></p>
  <p>1999-2000<BR>2003-2004<BR>2023-2024<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>Besides habitual grace, there are actual graces (gifts for specific 
circumstances), sacramental graces (gifts proper to each sacrament), special 
graces or charisms (gifts that are intended for the common good of the Church) 
among which are the graces of state that accompany the exercise of ecclesial 
ministries and the responsibilities of life.</p>
  <p><b>425. What is the relationship between grace and human freedom?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2001-2002</p>
  <p>Grace precedes, prepares and elicits our free response. It responds to the deep 
yearnings of human freedom, calls for its cooperation and leads freedom toward 
its perfection.</p>
  <p><b>426. What is merit?</b></p>
  <p>2006-2010<BR>2025-2026</p>
  <p>In general merit refers to the right to recompense for a good deed. With regard 
to God, we of ourselves are not able to merit anything, having received 
everything freely from him. However, God gives us the possibility of acquiring 
merit through union with the love of Christ, who is the source of our merits 
before God. The merits for good works, therefore must be attributed in the first 
place to the grace of God and then to the free will of man.</p>
  <p align="left"><b>427. What are the goods that we can merit?</b></p>
  <p>2010-2011<BR>2027</p>
  <p>Moved by the Holy Spirit, we can merit for ourselves and for others the graces 
needed for our sanctification and for the attainment of eternal life. Even 
temporal goods, suitable for us, can be merited in accordance with the plan of 
God. No one, however, can merit the <i>initial grace</i> which is at the origin 
of conversion and justification.</p>
  <p><b>428. Are all called to Christian holiness?</b></p>
  <p>2012-2016<BR>2028-2029&nbsp;</p>
  <p>All the faithful are called to Christian holiness. This is the fullness of 
Christian life and the perfection of charity and it is brought about by intimate 
union with Christ and, in him, with the most Holy Trinity. The path to holiness 
for a Christian goes by way of the cross and will come to its fulfillment in the 
final resurrection of the just, in which God will be all in all.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE CHURCH MOTHER AND TEACHER</font></b></p>
  <p><b>429. How does the Church nourish the moral life of a Christian?</b></p>
  <p>2030-2031<BR>2047</p>
  <p>The Church is the community in which the Christian receives the Word of God, the 
teachings of the "Law of Christ" (<i>Galatians</i> 6:2), and the grace of the 
sacraments. Christians are united to the Eucharistic sacrifice of Christ in such 
a way that their moral life is an act of spiritual worship; and they learn the 
example of holiness from the Virgin Mary and the lives of the Saints.</p>
  <p><b>430. Why does the Magisterium of the Church act in the field of morality?</b></p>
  <p>2032-2040<BR>2049-2051<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>It is the duty of the Magisterium of the Church to preach the faith that is to 
be believed and put into practice in life. This duty extends even to the 
specific precepts of the natural law because their observance is necessary for 
salvation.</p>
  <p><b>431. What purpose do the precepts of the Church have?</b></p>
  <p>2041<BR>2048</p>
  <p>The five precepts of the Church are meant to guarantee for the faithful the 
indispensable minimum in the spirit of prayer, the sacramental life, moral 
commitment and growth in love of God and neighbor.</p>
  <p><b>432. What are the precepts of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2042-2043&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They are: 1) to attend Mass on Sundays and other holy days of obligation and to 
refrain from work and activities which could impede the sanctification of those 
days; 2) to confess one&#39;s sins, receiving the sacrament of Reconciliation at 
least once each year; 3) to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist at least 
during the Easter season; 4) to abstain from eating meat and to observe the days 
of fasting established by the Church; and 5) to help to provide for the material 
needs of the Church, each according to his own ability.</p>
  <p><b>433. Why is the Christian moral life indispensable for the proclamation of the 
Gospel?</b></p>
  <p>2044-2046</p>
  <p>Because&nbsp;their lives are conformed to the Lord Jesus, Christians draw others to 
faith in the true God, build up the Church, inform the world with the spirit of 
the Gospel, and hasten the coming of the Kingdom of God.</p>

  <p><b>434. "Teacher, what good must I do to have eternal life?" (<i>Matthew</i> 19:16).</b></p>
  <p>2052-2054<BR>2075-2076</p>
  <p>To the young man who asked this question, Jesus answered, "If you would enter 
into life, keep the commandments", and then he added, "Come, follow Me" (<i>Matthew</i> 
19:16-21). To follow Jesus involves keeping the commandments. The law has not 
been abolished but man is invited to rediscover it in the Person of the divine 
Master who realized it perfectly in himself, revealed its full meaning and 
attested to its permanent validity.</p>
  <p><b>435. How did Jesus interpret the Law?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2055</p>
  <p>Jesus interpreted the Law in the light of the twofold yet single commandment of 
love, the fullness of the Law: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your 
heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the greatest and 
first commandment. And the second is like it: you shall love your neighbor as 
yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets" 
(<i>Matthew</i> 22:37-40).</p>
  <p><b>436. What does "Decalogue" mean?</b></p>
  <p>2056-2057</p>
  <p>Decalogue means "ten words" (<i>Exodus</i> 34:28). These words sum up the Law given by 
God to the people of Israel in the context of the Covenant mediated by Moses. 
This Decalogue, in presenting the commandments of the love of God (the first 
three) and of one&#39;s neighbor (the other seven), traces for the chosen people and 
for every person in particular the path to a life freed from the slavery of sin.</p>
  <p><b>437. What is the bond between the Decalogue and the Covenant?</b></p>
  <p>2058-2063<BR>2077</p>
  <p>The Decalogue must be understood in the light of the Covenant in which God 
revealed himself and made known his will. In observing the commandments, the 
people manifested their belonging to God and they answered his initiative of 
love with thanksgiving.</p>
  <p><b>438. What importance does the Church give to the Decalogue?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2064-2068</p>
  <p>The Church, in fidelity to Scripture and to the example of Christ, acknowledges 
the primordial importance and significance of the Decalogue. Christians are 
obliged to keep it.</p>
  <p><b>439. Why does the Decalogue constitute an organic unity?</b></p>
  <p>2069<BR>2079</p>
  <p>The Ten Commandments form an organic and indivisible whole because each 
commandment refers to the other commandments and to the entire Decalogue. To 
break one commandment, therefore, is to violate the entire law.</p>
  <p><b>440. Why does the Decalogue enjoin serious obligations?</b></p>
  <p>2072-2073<BR>2081</p>
  <p>It does so because the Decalogue expresses the fundamental duties of man towards 
God and towards his neighbor.</p>
  <p><b>441. Is it possible to keep the Decalogue?</b></p>
  <p>2074<BR>2082</p>
  <p>Yes, because Christ without whom we can do nothing enables us to keep it with 
the gift of his Spirit and his grace.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE FIRST COMMANDMENT: I AM THE LORD YOUR GOD, <BR>YOU SHALL NOT HAVE OTHER GODS BEFORE ME</font></b></p>
  <p><b>442. What is implied in the affirmation of God: "I am the Lord your God" (<i>Exodus</i> 
20:2)?</b></p>
  <p>2083-2094<BR>2133-2134</p>
  <p>This means that the faithful must guard and activate the three theological 
virtues and must avoid sins which are opposed to them. <i>Faith</i> believes in 
God and rejects everything that is opposed to it, such as, deliberate doubt, 
unbelief, heresy, apostasy, and schism. <i>Hope</i> trustingly awaits the 
blessed vision of God and his help, while avoiding despair and presumption. <i>
Charity</i> loves God above all things and therefore repudiates indifference, 
ingratitude, lukewarmness, sloth or spiritual indolence, and that hatred of God 
which is born of pride.</p>
  <p><b>443. What is the meaning of the words of our Lord, "Adore the Lord your God and 
worship Him alone" (<i>Matthew</i> 4:10)?</b></p>
  <p>2095-2105<BR>2135-2136&nbsp;</p>
  <p>These words mean to adore God as the Lord of everything that exists; to render 
to him the individual and community worship which is his due; to pray to him 
with sentiments of praise, of thanks, and of supplication; to offer him 
sacrifices, above all the spiritual sacrifice of one"s own life, united with the 
perfect sacrifice of Christ; and to keep the promises and vows made to him.</p>
  <p><b>444. In what way does a person exercise his or her proper right to worship God 
in truth and in freedom?</b></p>
  <p>2104-2109<BR>2137&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Every person has the right and the moral duty to seek the truth, especially in 
what concerns God and his Church. Once&nbsp; the truth is known, each person he has 
the right and moral duty to embrace it, to guard it faithfully and to render God 
authentic worship. At the same time, the dignity of the human person requires 
that in religious matters no one may be forced to act against conscience nor be 
restrained, within the just limits of public order, from acting in conformity 
with conscience, privately or publicly, alone or in association with others.</p>
  <p><b>445. What does God prohibit by his command, "You shall not have other gods 
before me" (<i>Exodus</i> 20:2)?</b></p>
  <p>2110-2128<BR>2138-2140&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This commandment forbids: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Polytheism</i>&nbsp;and <i>idolatry</i>, which divinizes creatures, power, money, or even 
demons.</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Superstition</i>&nbsp;which is a departure from the worship due to the true God and which also 
expresses itself in various forms of divination, magic, sorcery and spiritism. 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Irreligion</i>&nbsp;which is evidenced: in tempting God by word or deed; in sacrilege, which 
profanes sacred persons or sacred things, above all the Eucharist; and in 
simony, which involves the buying or selling of spiritual things. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Atheism</i>&nbsp;which rejects the existence of God, founded often on a false conception of 
human autonomy. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>Agnosticism</i>&nbsp;which affirms that nothing can be known about God, and involves 
indifferentism and practical atheism.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>446. Does the commandment of God, "You shall not make for yourself a graven 
image" (<i>Exodus</i> 20:3), forbid the cult of images?</b></p>
  <p>2129-2132<BR>2141&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In the Old Testament this commandment forbade any representation of God who is 
absolutely transcendent.  The Christian veneration of sacred images, however, is justified by the 
incarnation of the Son of God (as taught by the Second Council of Nicea in 
787AD) because such veneration is founded on the mystery of the Son of God made 
man, in whom the transcendent God is made visible. This does not mean the 
adoration of an image, but rather the veneration of the one who is represented 
in it:  for example, Christ, the Blessed Virgin Mary, the Angels and the Saints.

  <p>One shows respect for the holy Name of God by blessing it, praising it and 
glorifying it. It is forbidden, therefore, to call on the Name of God to justify 
a crime. It is also wrong to use the holy Name of God in any improper way as in
<i>blasphemy</i> (which by its nature is a grave sin), <i>curses</i>, and <i>
unfaithfulness</i> to promises made in the Name of God.</p>
  <p><b>448. Why is a false oath forbidden?</b></p>
  <p>2150-2151<BR>2163-2164&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is forbidden because one calls upon God who is truth itself to be the witness 
to a lie. </p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>449. What is perjury?</b></p>
  <p>2152-2155</p>
  <p>Perjury is to make a promise under oath with the intention of not keeping it or 
to violate a promise made under oath. It is a grave sin against God who is 
always faithful to his promises.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE THIRD COMMANDMENT:  <BR>REMEMBER TO KEEP HOLY THE LORD&#39;S DAY</font></b></p>
  <p><b>450. Why did God "bless the Sabbath day and declare it sacred" (<i>Exodus</i> 20:11)?</b></p>
  <p>2168-2172<BR>2189</p>
  <p>God did so because on the Sabbath day one remembers <i>God"s rest</i> on the 
seventh day of creation, and also the liberation of  Israel&nbsp;from slavery in  Egypt and the Covenant which God sealed with his people.</p>
  <p><b>451. How did Jesus act in regard to the Sabbath?</b></p>
  <p>2173</p>
  <p>Jesus recognized the holiness of the Sabbath day and with divine authority he 
gave this law its authentic interpretation: "The Sabbath was made for man, and 
not man for the sabbath" (<i>Mark</i> 2:27).</p>
  <p><b>452. For what reason has the Sabbath been changed to Sunday for Christians? 
  </b></p>
  <p>2174-2176<BR>2190-2191&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The reason is because Sunday is the day of the Resurrection of Christ. As "the 
first day of the week" (<i>Mark</i> 16:2) it recalls the first creation; and as the 
"eighth day", which follows the sabbath, it symbolizes the new creation ushered 
in by the Resurrection of Christ. Thus, it has become for Christians the first 
of all days and of all feasts. It is the <i>day of the Lord</i> in which he with 
his Passover fulfilled the spiritual truth of the Jewish Sabbath and proclaimed 
man"s eternal rest in God.</p>
  <p><b>453. How does one keep Sunday holy?</b></p>
  <p>2177-2185<BR>2192-2193&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Christians keep Sunday and other days of obligation holy by participating in the 
Eucharist of the Lord and by refraining from those activities which impede the 
worship of God and disturb the joy proper to the day of the Lord or the 
necessary relaxation of mind and body. Activities are allowed on the Sabbath 
which are bound up with family needs or with important social service, provided 
that they do not lead to habits prejudicial to the holiness of Sunday, to family 
life and to health. </p>
  <p><b>454. Why is the civil recognition of Sunday as a feast day important?</b></p>
  <p>2186-2188<BR>2194-2195&nbsp;</p>
  <p>It is important so that all might be given the real possibility of enjoying 
sufficient rest and leisure to take care of their religious, familial, cultural 
and social lives. It is important also to have an opportune time for meditation, 
for reflection, for silence, for study, and a time to dedicate to good works, 
particularly for the sick and for the elderly.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE FOURTH COMMANDMENT:  <BR>HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER</font></b></p>
  <p><b>455. What does the fourth commandment require?</b></p>
  <p>2196-2200<BR>2247-2248</p>
  <p>It commands us to honor and respect our parents and those whom God, for our 
good, has vested with his authority.</p>
  <p><b>456. What is the nature of the family in the plan of God?</b></p>
  <p>2201-2205<BR>2249</p>
  <p>A man and a woman united in marriage form a family together with their children. 
God instituted the family and endowed it with its fundamental constitution. 
Marriage and the family are ordered to the good of the spouses and to the 
procreation and education of children. Members of the same family establish 
among themselves personal relationships and primary responsibilities. In Christ 
the family becomes the <i>domestic church</i> because it is a community of 
faith, of hope, and of charity.</p>
  <p><b>457. What place does the family occupy in society?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2207-2208</p>
  <p>The family is the original cell of human society and is, therefore, prior to any 
recognition by public authority. Family values and principles constitute the 
foundation of social life. Family life is an initiation into the life of 
society.</p>
  <p><b>458. What are the duties that society has toward the family?</b></p>
  <p>2209-2213<BR>2250</p>
  <p>Society, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, has the duty to support 
and strengthen marriage and the family. Public authority must respect, protect 
and foster the true nature of marriage and the family, public morality, the 
rights of parents, and domestic prosperity. </p>
  <p><b>459. What are the duties of children toward their parents?</b></p>
  <p>2214-2220<BR>2251</p>
  <p>Children owe respect (filial piety), gratitude, docility and obedience to their 
parents. In paying them respect and in fostering good relationships with their 
brothers and sisters, children contribute to the growth in harmony and holiness 
in family life in general.  Adult children should give their parents material and moral support whenever 
they find themselves in situations of distress, sickness, loneliness, or old 
age.</p>
  <p><b>460. What are the duties of parents toward their children?</b></p>
  <p>2221-2231</p>
  <p>Parents, in virtue of their participation in the fatherhood of God, have the 
first responsibility for the education of their children and they are the first 
heralds of the faith for them. They have the duty to love and respect their 
children as <i>persons</i> and as <i>children of God</i> and to provide, as far 
as is possible, for their physical and spiritual needs. They should select for 
them a suitable school and help them with prudent counsel in the choice of their 
profession and their state of life. In particular they have the mission of 
educating their children in the Christian faith.</p>
  <p><b>461. How are parents to educate their children in the Christian faith?</b></p>
  <p>2252-2253</p>
  <p>Parents do this mainly by example, prayer, family catechesis and participation 
in the life of the Church.</p>
  <p><b>462. Are family bonds an absolute good?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2232-2233</p>
  <p>Family ties are important but not absolute, because the first vocation of a 
Christian is to follow Jesus and love him: "He who loves father or mother more 
than me is not worthy of me; whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not 
worthy of me" (<i>Matthew</i> 10:37). Parents must support with joy their children&#39;s 
choice to follow Jesus in whatever state of life, even in the consecrated life 
or the priestly ministry.</p>
  <p><b>463. How should authority be exercised in the various spheres of civil society?</b></p>
  <p>2234-2237<BR>2254&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Authority&nbsp;should always be exercised as a service, respecting fundamental human 
rights, a just hierarchy of values, laws, distributive justice, and the 
principle of subsidiarity. All those who exercise authority should seek the 
interests of the community before their own interest and allow their decisions 
to be inspired by the truth about God, about man and about the world.</p>
  <p><b>464. What are the duties of citizens in regard to civil authorities?</b></p>
  <p>2238-2241<BR>2255&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Those subject to authority should regard those in authority as representatives 
of God and offer their loyal collaboration for the right functioning of public 
and social life. This collaboration includes love and service of one&#39;s homeland, 
the right and duty to vote, payment of taxes, the defense of one&#39;s country, and 
the right to exercise constructive criticism. </p>
  <p><b>465. When is a citizen forbidden to obey civil authorities?</b></p>
  <p>2242-2243<BR>2256&nbsp;</p>
  <p>A citizen is obliged in conscience not to obey the laws of civil authorities 
when they are contrary to the demands of the moral order: "We must obey God 
rather than men" (<i>Acts of the Apostles</i> 5:29).</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE FIFTH COMMANDMENT:  <BR>YOU SHALL NOT KILL</font></b></p>
  <p><b>466. Why must human life be respected?</b></p>
  <p>2258-2262<BR>2318-2320&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Human life must be respected because it is <i>sacred</i>. From its beginning 
human life involves the creative action of God and it remains forever in a 
special relationship with the Creator, who is its sole end. It is not lawful for 
anyone directly to destroy an innocent human being. This is gravely contrary to 
the dignity of the person and the holiness of the Creator. "Do not slay the 
innocent and the righteous" (<i>Exodus</i> 23:7).</p>
  <p><b>467. Why is the legitimate defense of persons and of society not opposed to this 
norm?</b></p>
  <p>2263-2265</p>
  <p>Because in choosing to legitimately defend oneself one is respecting the right 
to life (either one"s own right to life or that of another) and not choosing to 
kill. Indeed, for someone responsible for the life of another, legitimate defense can be not only a right but a grave duty, provided only that 
disproportionate force is not used.</p>
  <p><b>468. What is the purpose of punishment?</b></p>
  <p>2266</p>
  <p>A punishment imposed by legitimate public authority has the aim of redressing 
the disorder introduced by the offense, of defending public order and people"s 
safety, and contributing to the correction of the guilty party.</p>
  <p><b>469. What kind of punishment may be imposed?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2267</p>
  <p>The punishment imposed must be proportionate to the gravity of the offense. 
Given the possibilities which the State now has for effectively preventing crime 
by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm, the cases 
in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity "are very rare, 
if not practically non-existent." (<i>Evangelium Vitae</i>). When non-lethal 
means are sufficient, authority should limit itself to such means because they 
better correspond to the concrete conditions of the common good, are more in 
conformity with the dignity of the human person, and do not remove definitively 
from the guilty party the possibility of reforming himself. </p>
  <p><b>470. What is forbidden by the fifth commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2268-2283<BR>2321-2326</p>
  <p>The fifth commandment forbids as gravely contrary to the moral law: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>direct and intentional murder</i>&nbsp;and cooperation in it;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>direct abortion</i>, willed as an end or as means, as well as cooperation in it. Attached to this 
sin is the penalty of excommunication because, from the moment of his or her 
conception, the human being must be absolutely respected and protected in his 
integrity;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>direct euthanasia</i>&nbsp;which consists in putting an end to the life of the handicapped, the sick, 
or those near death by an act or by the omission of a required action;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>suicide</i>&nbsp;and voluntary cooperation in it, insofar as it is a grave offense against 
the just love of God, of self, and of neighbor. One"s responsibility may be 
aggravated by the scandal given; one who is psychologically disturbed or is 
experiencing grave fear may have diminished responsibility. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>471. What medical procedures are permitted when death is considered imminent? 
  </b></p>
  <p>2278-2279</p>
  <p>When death is considered imminent the ordinary care owed to a sick person cannot 
be legitimately interrupted. However, it is legitimate to use pain-killers which 
do not aim at in death and to refuse "over-zealous treatment", that is the 
utilization of disproportionate medical procedures without reasonable hope of a 
positive outcome.</p>
  <p><b>472. Why must society protect every embryo?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2273-2274</p>
  <p>The inalienable right to life of every human individual from the first moment of 
conception is a constitutive element of civil society and its legislation. When 
the State does not place its power at the service of the rights of all and in 
particular of the more vulnerable, including unborn children, the very 
foundations of a State based on law are undermined. </p>
  <p><b>473. How does one avoid scandal?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2284-2287</p>
  <p>Scandal, which consists in inducing others to do evil, is avoided when we 
respect the soul and body of the person. Anyone who deliberately leads others to 
commit serious sins himself commits a grave offense.</p>
  <p><b>474. What duty do we have toward our body?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2288-2291</p>
  <p>We must take reasonable <i>care of our own physical health</i> and that of 
others but avoid the <i>cult of the body</i> and every kind of excess. Also to 
be avoided are the use of drugs which cause very serious damage to human health 
and life, as well as the abuse of food, alcohol, tobacco and medicine.</p>
  <p><b>475. When are scientific, medical, or psychological experiments on human 
individuals or groups morally legitimate?</b></p>
  <p>2292-2295</p>
  <p>They are morally legitimate when they are at the service of the integral good of 
the person and of society, without disproportionate risks to the life and 
physical and psychological integrity of the subjects who must be properly 
informed and consenting. </p>
  <p><b>476. Are the transplant and donation of organs allowed before and after death?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2296</p>
  <p>The transplant of organs is morally acceptable with the consent of the donor and 
without excessive risks to him or her. Before allowing the noble act of organ 
donation after death, one must verify that the donor is truly dead.</p>
  <p><b>477. What practices are contrary to respect for the bodily integrity of the 
human person?</b></p>
  <p>2297-2298</p>
  <p>They are: kidnapping and hostage taking, terrorism, torture, violence, and 
direct sterilization. Amputations and mutilations of a person are morally 
permissible only for strictly therapeutic medical reasons.</p>
  <p><b>478. What care must be given to the dying?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2299</p>
  <p>The dying have a right to live the last moments of their earthly lives with 
dignity and, above all, to be sustained with prayer and the sacraments that 
prepare them to meet the living God.</p>
  <p><b>479. How are the bodies of the deceased to be treated?</b></p>
  <p>2300-2301</p>
  <p>The bodies of the departed must be treated with love and respect. Their 
cremation is permitted provided that it does not demonstrate a denial of faith 
in the resurrection of the body.</p>
  <p><b>480. What does the Lord ask of every person in regard to peace?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2302-2303</p>
  <p>The Lord proclaimed "<i>Blessed</i> are the peacemakers" (<i>Matthew</i> 5:9). He 
called for peace of heart and denounced the immorality of anger which is a 
desire for revenge for some evil suffered. He also denounced hatred which leads 
one to wish evil on one"s neighbor. These attitudes, if voluntary and consented 
to in matters of great importance, are mortal sins against charity.</p>
  <p><b>481. What is peace in this world?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2304-2305</p>
  <p>Peace in this world, which is required for the respect and development of human 
life, is not simply the absence of war or a balance of power between 
adversaries. It is "the tranquility of order" (Saint Augustine), "the work of 
justice" (<i>Isaiah</i> 32:17) and the effect of charity. Earthly peace is the image 
and fruit of the peace of Christ.</p>
  <p><b>482. What is required for earthly peace?</b></p>
  <p>2304<BR>2307-2308</p>
  <p>Earthly peace requires the equal distribution and safeguarding of the goods of 
persons, free communication among human beings, respect for the dignity of 
persons and peoples, and the assiduous practice of justice and fraternity.</p>
  <p><b>483. When is it morally permitted to use military force?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2307-2310</p>
  <p>The use of military force is morally justified when the following conditions are 
simultaneously present: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the suffering inflicted by the aggressor must be lasting, grave and certain; 
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>all other peaceful means must have been shown to be ineffective;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>there are well founded prospects of success; </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>the use of arms, especially given the power of modern weapons of mass 
destruction, must not produce evils graver than the evil to be eliminated.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>484. In&nbsp;danger of war, who has the responsibility for the rigorous evaluation of 
these conditions?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2309</p>
  <p>This responsibility belongs to the prudential judgment of government officials 
who also have the right to impose on citizens the obligation of national 
defense. The personal right to conscientious objection makes an exception to 
this obligation which should then be carried out by another form of service to 
the human community. </p>
  <p><b>485. In&nbsp;case of war, what does the moral law require?</b></p>
  <p>2312-2314<BR>2328&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Even during a war the moral law always remains valid. It requires the humane 
treatment of noncombatants, wounded soldiers and prisoners of war. Deliberate 
actions contrary to the law of nations, and the orders that command such actions 
are crimes, which blind obedience does not excuse. Acts of mass destruction must 
be condemned and likewise the extermination of peoples or ethnic minorities, 
which are most grievous sins. One is morally bound to resist the orders that 
command such acts.</p>
  <p><b>486. What must be done to avoid war?</b></p>
  <p>2315-2317<br>
  2327-2330</p>
  <p>Because of the evils and injustices that all war brings with it, we must do 
everything reasonably possible to avoid it. To this end it is particularly 
important to avoid: the accumulation and sale of arms which are not regulated by 
the legitimate authorities; all forms of economic and social injustice; ethnic 
and religious discrimination; envy, mistrust, pride and the spirit of revenge. 
Everything done to overcome these and other disorders contributes to building up 
peace and avoiding war.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SIXTH COMMANDMENT:  <BR>YOU SHALL NOT COMMIT ADULTERY</font></b></p>
  <p><b>487. What responsibility do human persons have in regard to their own sexual 
identity?</b></p>
  <p>2331-2336<BR>2392-2393</p>
  <p>God has created human beings as male and female, equal in personal dignity, and 
has called them to a vocation of love and of communion. Everyone should accept 
his or her identity as male or female, recognizing its importance for the whole 
of the person, its specificity and complementarity.</p>
  <p><b>488. What is chastity?</b></p>
  <p>2337-2338</p>
  <p>Chastity means the positive integration of sexuality within the person. 
Sexuality becomes truly human when it is integrated in a correct way into the 
relationship of one person to another. Chastity is a moral virtue, a gift of 
God, a grace, and a fruit of the Holy Spirit.</p>
  <p><b>489. What is involved in the virtue of chastity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2339-2341</p>
  <p>The virtue of chastity involves an apprenticeship in self-mastery as an 
expression of human freedom directed towards self-giving. An integral and 
continuing formation, which is brought about in stages, is necessary to achieve 
this goal. </p>
  <p><b>490. What are the means that aid the living of chastity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2340-2347</p>
  <p>There are many means at one&#39;s disposal: the grace of God, the help of the 
sacraments, prayer, self-knowledge, the practice of an asceticism adapted to 
various situations, the exercise of the moral virtues, especially the virtue of 
temperance which seeks to have the passions guided by reason.</p>
  <p><b>491. In&nbsp;what way is everyone called to live chastity?</b></p>
  <p>2348-2350<BR>2394</p>
  <p>As followers of Christ, the model of all chastity, all the baptised are called 
to live chastely in keeping with their particular states of life. Some profess 
virginity or consecrated celibacy which enables them to give themselves to God 
alone with an undivided heart in a remarkable manner. Others, if they are 
married live in conjugal chastity, or if unmarried practise chastity in 
continence.</p>
  <p><b>492. What are the principal sins against chastity?</b></p>
  <p>2351-2359<BR>2396</p>
  <p>Grave sins against chastity differ according to their object: adultery, 
masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution, rape, and homosexual acts. 
These sins are expressions of the vice of lust. These kinds of acts committed 
against the physical and moral integrity of minors become even more grave.</p>
  <p><b>493. Although it says only "you shall not commit adultery" why does the sixth 
commandment forbid all sins against chastity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2336&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Although the biblical text of the Decalogue reads "you shall not commit 
adultery" (<i>Exodus</i> 20:14), the Tradition of the Church comprehensively follows 
the moral teachings of the Old and New Testaments and considers the sixth 
commandment as encompassing all sins against chastity.</p>
  <p><b>494. What is the responsibility of civil authority in regard to chastity?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2354</p>
  <p>Insofar as it is bound to promote respect for the dignity of the person, civil 
authority should seek to create an environment conducive to the practice of 
chastity. It should also enact suitable legislation to prevent the spread of the 
grave offenses against chastity mentioned above, especially in order to protect 
minors and those who are the weakest members of society.</p>
  <p><b>495. What are the goods of conjugal love to which sexuality is ordered?</b></p>
  <p>2360-2361<BR>2397-2398</p>
  <p>The goods of conjugal love, which for those who are baptized is sanctified by 
the sacrament of Matrimony, are unity, fidelity, indissolubility, and an 
openness to the procreation of life.</p>
  <p><b>496. What is the meaning of the conjugal act?</b></p>
  <p>2362-2367</p>
  <p>The conjugal act has a twofold meaning: unitive (the mutual self-giving of the 
spouses) and procreative (an openness to the transmission of life). No one may 
break the inseparable connection which God has established between these two 
meanings of the conjugal act by excluding one or the other of them.</p>
  <p><b>497. When is it moral to regulate births?</b></p>
  <p>2368-2369<BR>2399</p>
  <p>The regulation of births, which is an aspect of responsible fatherhood and 
motherhood, is objectively morally acceptable when it is pursued by the spouses 
without external pressure; when it is practiced not out of selfishness but for 
serious reasons; and with methods that conform to the objective criteria of 
morality, that is, periodic continence and use of the infertile periods.</p>
  <p><b>498. What are immoral means of birth control?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2370-2372</p>
  <p>Every action - for example, direct sterilization or contraception - is 
intrinsically immoral which (either in anticipation of the conjugal act, in its 
accomplishment or in the development of its natural consequences) proposes, as 
an end or as a means, to hinder procreation.</p>
  <p><b>499. Why are artificial insemination and artificial fertilization immoral?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2373-2377</p>
  <p>They are immoral because they dissociate procreation from the act with which the 
spouses give themselves to each other and so introduce the domination of 
technology over the origin and destiny of the human person. Furthermore, 
heterologous insemination and fertilization with the use of techniques that 
involve a person other than the married couple infringe upon the right of a 
child to be born of a father and mother known to him, bound to each other by 
marriage and having the exclusive right to become parents only through each 
another.</p>
  <p><b>500. How should children be considered?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2378</p>
  <p>A child is a <i>gift of God</i>, the supreme gift of marriage. There is no such 
thing as a right to have children (e.g. "a child at any cost"). But a child does 
have the right to be the fruit of the conjugal act of its parents as well as the 
right to be respected as a person from the moment of conception.</p>
  <p><b>501. What can spouses do when they do not have children?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2379</p>
  <p>Should the gift of a child not be given to them, after exhausting all legitimate 
medical options, spouses can show their generosity by way of foster care or 
adoption or by performing meaningful services for others. In this way they 
realize a precious spiritual fruitfulness. </p>
  <p><b>502. What are the offenses against the dignity of marriage?</b></p>
  <p>2380-2391<BR>2400</p>
  <p>These are: adultery, divorce, polygamy, incest, free unions (cohabitation, 
concubinage), and sexual acts before or outside of marriage.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SEVENTH COMMANDMENT:  <BR>YOU SHALL NOT STEAL</font></b></p>
  <p><b>503. What is set forth by the seventh commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2401-2402</p>
  <p>The seventh commandment requires respect for the universal destination and 
distribution of goods and the private ownership of them, as well as respect for 
persons, their property, and the integrity of creation. The Church also finds in 
this Commandment the basis for her social doctrine which involves the correct 
way of acting in economic, social and political life, the right and the duty of 
human labor, justice and solidarity among nations, and love for the poor. </p>
  <p><b>504. Under what conditions does the right to private property exist?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2403&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The right to private property exists provided the property is acquired or 
received in a just way and that the universal destination of goods for the 
satisfaction of the basic needs of all takes precedence.</p>
  <p><b>505. What is the purpose of private property?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2404-2406</p>
  <p>The purpose of private property is to guarantee the freedom and dignity of 
individual persons by helping them to meet the basic needs of those in their 
charge and also of others who are in need.</p>
  <p><b>506. What does the seventh commandment require?</b></p>
  <p>2407<BR>2450-2451</p>
  <p>The seventh commandment requires respect for the goods of others through the 
practice of justice and charity, temperance and solidarity. In particular it 
requires <i>respect for promises made and contracts agreed to</i>, <i>reparation 
for injustice</i> committed and restitution of stolen goods, and respect for the
<i>integrity of creation</i> by the prudent and moderate use of the mineral, 
vegetable, and animal resources of the universe with special attention to those 
species which are in danger of extinction.</p>
  <p><b>507. What attitude should people have toward animals?</b></p>
  <p>2416-2418<BR>2457&nbsp;</p>
  <p>People&nbsp;must treat animals with kindness as creatures of God and avoid both 
excessive love for them and an indiscriminate use of them especially by 
scientific experiments that go beyond reasonable limits and entail needless 
suffering for the animals.</p>
  <p><b>508. What is forbidden by the seventh commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2408-2413<BR>2453-2455</p>
  <p>Above all, the seventh commandment forbids theft, which is the taking or using 
of another"s property against the reasonable will of the owner. This can be done 
also by paying unjust wages; by speculation on the value of goods in order to 
gain an advantage to the detriment of others; or by the forgery of checks or 
invoices. Also forbidden is tax evasion or business fraud; willfully damaging 
private or public property ; usury; corruption; the private abuse of common 
goods; work deliberately done poorly; and waste.</p>
  <p><b>509. What is the content of the social doctrine of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2419-2423</p>
  <p>The social doctrine of the Church is an organic development of the truth of the 
Gospel about the dignity of the human person and his social dimension offering 
principles for reflection, criteria for judgment, and norms and guidelines for 
action.</p>
  <p><b>510. When does the Church intervene in social areas?</b></p>
  <p>2420<BR>2458</p>
  <p>The Church intervenes by making a moral judgment about economic and social 
matters when the fundamental rights of the person, the common good, or the 
salvation of souls requires it.</p>
  <p><b>511. How should social and economic life be pursued?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2459</p>
  <p>It should be pursued according to its own proper methods within the sphere of 
the moral order, at the service of the whole human being and of the entire human 
community in keeping with social justice. Social and economic life should have 
the human person as its author, center, and goal.</p>
  <p><b>512. What would be opposed to the social doctrine of the Church?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2424-2425</p>
  <p>Opposed to the social doctrine of the Church are economic and social systems 
that sacrifice the basic rights of persons or that make profit their exclusive 
norm or ultimate end. For this reason the Church rejects the ideologies 
associated in modern times with Communism or with atheistic and totalitarian 
forms of socialism. But in the practice of capitalism the Church also rejects 
self centered individualism and an absolute primacy of the laws of the 
marketplace over human labor.</p>
  <p><b>513. What is the meaning of work?</b></p>
  <p>2426-2428<BR>2460-2461<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Work is both a duty and a right through which human beings collaborate with God 
the Creator. Indeed, by working with commitment and competence we fulfil the 
potential inscribed in our nature, honor the Creator"s gifts and the talents 
received from him, provide for ourselves and for our families, and serve the 
human community. Furthermore, by the grace of God, work can be a means of 
sanctification and collaboration with Christ for the salvation of others.</p>
  <p><b>514. To what type of work does every person have a right?</b></p>
  <p>2429<BR>2433-2434</p>
  <p>Access to secure and honest employment must be open to all without unjust 
discrimination and with respect for free economic initiative and fair 
compensation.</p>
  <p><b>515. What responsibility does the State have in regard to labor?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2431</p>
  <p>It is the role of the State to guarantee individual freedom and private 
property, as well as a stable currency and efficient public services. It is also 
the State"s responsibility to oversee and direct the exercise of human rights in 
the economic sector. According to circumstances, society must help citizens to 
find work.</p>
  <p><b>516. What is the task of business management?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2432</p>
  <p>Business managers are responsible for the economic and ecological effects of 
their operations. They must consider the good of persons and not only the 
increase of profits, even though profits are necessary to assure investments, 
the future of the business, employment, and the good progress of economic life.</p>
  <p><b>517. What are the duties of workers?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2435</p>
  <p>They must carry out their work in a conscientious way with competence and 
dedication, seeking to resolve any controversies with dialogue. Recourse to a 
non-violent strike is morally legitimate when it appears to be the necessary way 
to obtain a proportionate benefit and it takes into account the common good.</p>
  <p><b>518. How is justice and solidarity among nations brought about?</b></p>
  <p>2437-2441</p>
  <p>On the international level, all nations and institutions must carry out their 
work in solidarity and subsidiarity for the purpose of eliminating or at least 
reducing poverty, the inequality of resources and economic potential, economic 
and social injustices, the exploitation of persons, the accumulation of debts by 
poor countries, and the perverse mechanisms that impede the development of the 
less advanced countries.</p>
  <p><b>519. In&nbsp;what way do Christians participate in political and social life?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2442</p>
  <p>The lay faithful take part directly in political and social life by animating 
temporal realities with a Christian spirit and collaborating with all as 
authentic witnesses of the Gospel and agents of peace and justice.</p>
  <p><b>520. By what is love for the poor inspired?</b></p>
  <p>2443-2449<BR>2462-2463&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Love for the poor is inspired by the Gospel of the Beatitudes and by the example 
of Jesus in his constant concern for the poor. Jesus said, "Whatever you have 
done to the least of my brethren, you have done to me" (<i>Matthew</i> 25:40). Love for 
the poor shows itself through the struggle against material poverty and also 
against the many forms of cultural, moral, and religious poverty. The spiritual 
and corporal works of mercy and the many charitable institutions formed 
throughout the centuries are a concrete witness to the preferential love for the 
poor which characterizes the disciples of Jesus.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE EIGHTH COMMANDMENT:<BR>YOU SHALL NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS AGAINST YOUR NEIGHBOR</font></b></p>
  <p><b>521. What is one"s duty toward the truth?</b></p>
  <p>2464-2470<BR>2504</p>
  <p>Every person is called to sincerity and truthfulness in acting and speaking. 
Everyone has the duty to seek the truth, to adhere to it and to order one"s 
whole life in accordance with its demands. In Jesus Christ the whole of God"s 
truth has been made manifest. He is "<i>the truth</i>". Those who follow him 
live in the Spirit of truth and guard against duplicity, dissimulation, and 
hypocrisy.</p>
  <p><b>522. How does one bear witness to the truth?</b></p>
  <p>2471-2474<BR>2505-2506</p>
  <p>A Christian must bear witness to the truth of the Gospel in every field of his 
activity, both public and private, and also if necessary, with the sacrifice of 
his very life. Martyrdom is the supreme witness given to the truth of the faith.</p>
  <p><b>523. What is forbidden by the eighth commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2475-2487<BR>2507-2509&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The eighth commandment forbids: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>false witness</i>, <i>perjury</i>, and <i>lying</i>, the gravity of which is measured by the 
truth it deforms, the circumstances, the intentions of the one who lies, and the 
harm suffered by its victims;</li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>rash judgment</i>, <i>slander</i>, <i>defamation</i> and <i>calumny</i> which diminish or destroy 
the good reputation and honor to which every person has a right; </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li> <i>flattery</i>, <i>adulation</i>, or <i>complaisance</i>, especially if directed to serious 
sins or toward the achievement of illicit advantages.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A sin committed against truth demands reparation if it has caused harm to 
others.</p>
  <p><b>524. What is required by the eighth commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2488-2492<BR>2510-2511</p>
  <p>The eighth commandment requires respect for the truth accompanied by the 
discretion of charity in the field of <i>communication </i>and the<i> imparting 
of information</i>, where the personal and common good, the protection of 
privacy and the danger of scandal must all be taken into account; in respecting
<i>professional secrets</i> which must be kept, save in exceptional cases for 
grave and proportionate reasons; and also in respecting <i>confidences</i> given 
under the seal of secrecy.</p>
  <p><b>525. How is one to use the means of social communication?</b></p>
  <p>2493-2499<BR>2512</p>
  <p>The information provided by the media must be at the service of the common good. 
Its content must be true and " within the limits of justice and charity " also 
complete. Furthermore, information must be communicated honestly and properly 
with scrupulous respect for moral laws and the legitimate rights and dignity of 
the person.</p>
  <p><b>526. What relationship exists between truth, beauty and sacred art?</b></p>
  <p>2500-2503<BR>2513&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The truth is beautiful, carrying in itself the splendour of spiritual beauty. In 
addition to the expression of the truth in words there are other complementary 
expressions of the truth, most specifically in the beauty of artistic works.&nbsp;These are the fruit both of talents given by God and of human effort. <i>
Sacred art</i> by being true and beautiful should evoke and glorify the mystery 
of God made visible in Christ, and lead to the adoration and love of God, the 
Creator and Savior, who is the surpassing, invisible Beauty of Truth and Love.

  <p><b>527. What is required by the ninth commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2514-2516<BR>2528-2530</p>
  <p>The ninth commandment requires that one overcome carnal concupiscence in thought 
and in desire. The struggle against such concupiscence entails purifying the 
heart and practicing the virtue of temperance.</p>
  <p><b>528. What is forbidden by the ninth commandment?</b></p>
  <p>2517-2519<BR>2531-2532</p>
  <p>The ninth commandment forbids cultivating thoughts and desires connected to 
actions forbidden by the sixth commandment.</p>
  <p><b>529. How does one reach purity of heart?</b></p>
  <p>2520</p>
  <p>In the battle against disordered desires the baptised person is able, by the 
grace of God, to achieve purity of heart through the virtue and gift of 
chastity, through purity of intention, purity of vision (both exterior and 
interior), discipline of the imagination and of feelings and by prayer.</p>
  <p><b>530. What are the other requirements for purity?</b></p>
  <p>2521-2527<BR>2533</p>
  <p>Purity requires <i>modesty</i> which, while protecting the intimate center of 
the person, expresses the sensitivity of chastity. It guides how one looks at 
others and behaves toward them in conformity with the dignity of persons and 
their communion. Purity frees one from wide-spread eroticism and avoids those 
things which foster morbid curiosity. Purity also requires a <i>purification of 
the social climate</i> by means of a constant struggle against moral 
permissiveness which is founded on an erroneous conception of human freedom.</p>

  <p>This commandment, which completes the preceding commandment, requires an 
interior attitude of respect for the property of others and forbids <i>greed</i>,
<i>unbridled covetousness</i> for the goods of others, and <i>envy</i> which is 
the sadness one experiences at the sight of another"s goods and the immoderate 
desire to acquire them for oneself.</p>
  <p><b>532. What does Jesus call for in poverty of spirit?</b></p>
  <p>2544-2547<BR>2556&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Jesus calls his disciples to prefer him to everything and everyone.  Detachment from riches " in the spirit of evangelical poverty " and 
self-abandonment to divine providence free us from anxiety about the future and 
prepare us for the blessedness of the "poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom 
of heaven" (<i>Mathew</i> 5:3).</p>
  <p><b>533. What is the greatest human desire?</b></p>
  <p>2548-2550<BR>2557</p>
  <p>The greatest desire of the human person is to see God. "I want to see God" is 
the cry of our whole being. We realize our true and full happiness in the vision 
and beatitude of the One who created us out of love and draws us to himself with 
infinite love.</p>

  <p><b>534.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2558-2565<BR>2590</p>
  <p>Prayer is the raising of one"s mind and heart to God, or the petition of good 
things from him in accord with his will. It is always the gift of God who comes 
to encounter man. Christian prayer is the personal and living relationship of 
the children of God with their Father who is infinitely good, with his Son Jesus 
Christ, and with the Holy Spirit who dwells in their hearts.</p>

  <p><b>535.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why is there a universal call to prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2566-2567<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Because through creation God first calls every being from nothingness. Even 
after the Fall man continues to be capable of recognizing his Creator and 
retains a desire for the One who has called him into existence. All religions, 
and the whole history of salvation in particular, bear witness to this human 
desire for God. It is God first of all, however, who ceaselessly draws every 
person to the mysterious encounter known as prayer.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE REVELATION OF PRAYER<BR>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</font></b></p>
  <p><b>536.</b>&nbsp;<b>How is Abraham a model of prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2570-2573<BR>2592&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Abraham is a model of prayer because he walked in the presence of God, heard and 
obeyed him. His prayer was a battle of faith because he continued to believe in 
the fidelity of God even in times of trial. Besides, after having received in 
his own tent the visit of the Lord who confided his plan to him, Abraham dared 
to intercede for sinners with bold confidence.</p>
  <p><b>537.</b>&nbsp;<b>How did Moses pray?</b></p>
  <p>2574-2577<BR>2593</p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>The prayer of Moses was typical of contemplative prayer. God, who called to 
Moses from the burning bush, lingered in conversation with him often and at 
length, "face to face, like a man with his friend" (<i>Exodus</i> 33:11). In this 
intimacy with God, Moses attained the strength to intercede tenaciously for his 
people: his prayer thus prefigured the intercession of the one mediator, Christ 
Jesus.</p>
  <p><b>538.</b>&nbsp;<b>In&nbsp;the Old Testament, what relationship do the king and the temple have to 
prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2578-2580<BR>2594&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The prayer of the People of God developed in the shadow of the dwelling place of 
God " the Ark of the Covenant, then the Temple " under the guidance of their 
shepherds. Among them there was David, the King "after God"s own heart," the 
shepherd who prayed for his people. His prayer was a model for the prayer of the 
people because it involved clinging to the divine promise and a trust filled 
with love for the One who is the only King and Lord.</p>
  <p><b>539.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the role of prayer in the mission of the prophets?</b></p>
  <p>2581-2584</p>
  <p>The prophets drew from prayer the light and strength to exhort the people to 
faith and to conversion of heart. They entered into great intimacy with God and 
interceded for their brothers and sisters to whom they proclaimed what they had 
seen and heard from the Lord. Elijah was the father of the prophets, of those 
who sought the face of God. On Mount Carmel he achieved the return of the people 
to the faith, thanks to the intervention of God to whom he prayed: "Answer me, O 
Lord, answer me!" (<i>1 Kings </i>18:37).</p>
  <p><b>540.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the importance of the Psalms in prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2579<BR>2585-2589<BR>2596-2597</p>
  <p>The Psalms are the summit of prayer in the Old Testament: the Word of God become 
the prayer of man. Inseparably both personal and communal, and inspired by the 
Holy Spirit, this prayer sings of God"s marvelous deeds in creation and in the 
history of salvation. Christ prayed the Psalms and brought them to fulfillment. 
Thus they remain an essential and permanent element of the prayer of the Church 
suited to people of every condition and time.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">PRAYER IS FULLY REVEALED AND REALIZED IN JESUS</font></b></p>
  <p><b>541.</b>&nbsp;<b>From whom did Jesus learn how to pray?</b></p>
  <p>2599<BR>2620</p>
  <p>Jesus, with his human heart, learned how to pray from his mother and from the 
Jewish tradition. But his prayer sprang from a more secret source because he is 
the eternal Son of God who in his holy humanity offers his perfect filial prayer 
to his Father.</p>
  <p><b>542.</b>&nbsp;<b>When did Jesus pray?</b></p>
  <p>2600-2604<BR>2620<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>The Gospel often shows Jesus at prayer. We see him draw apart to pray in 
solitude, even at night. He prays before the decisive moments of his mission or 
that of his apostles. In fact, all his life is a prayer because he is in a 
constant communion of love with the Father.</p>
  <p><b>543.</b>&nbsp;<b>How did Jesus pray during his passion?</b></p>
  <p>2605-2606<BR>2620</p>
  <p>The prayer of Jesus during his agony in the garden of Gethsemani and his last 
words on the cross reveal the depth of his filial prayer. Jesus brings to 
completion the loving plan of the Father and takes upon himself all the anguish 
of humanity and all the petitions and intercessions of the history of salvation. 
He presents them to the Father who accepts them and answers them beyond all hope 
by raising his Son from the dead.</p>
  <p><b>544.</b>&nbsp;<b>How does Jesus teach us to pray?</b></p>
  <p>2608-2614<BR>2621&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Jesus teaches us to pray not only with the <i>Our Father</i> but also when he 
prays. In this way he teaches us, in addition to the content, the dispositions 
necessary for every true prayer: purity of heart that seeks the Kingdom and 
forgives one"s enemies, bold and filial faith that goes beyond what we feel and 
understand, and watchfulness that protects the disciple from temptation. </p>
  <p><b>545.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why is our prayer efficacious?</b></p>
  <p>2615-2616</p>
  <p>Our prayer is efficacious because it is united in faith with the prayer of 
Jesus. In him Christian prayer becomes a communion of love with the Father. In 
this way we can present our petitions to God and be heard: "Ask and you will 
receive that your joy may be full" (<i>John</i> 16:24). </p>
  <p><b>546.</b>&nbsp;<b>How did the Virgin Mary pray?</b></p>
  <p>2617, 2618<BR>2622, 2674<BR>2679</p>
  <p>Mary"s prayer was characterized by faith and by the generous offering of her 
whole being to God. The Mother of Jesus is also the new Eve, the "Mother of all 
the living". She prays to Jesus for the needs of all people.</p>
  <p><b>547.</b>&nbsp;<b>Is there a prayer of Mary in the Gospel?</b></p>
  <p>2619</p>
  <p>Along with the prayer of Mary at Cana in Galilee, the Gospel gives us the <i>
Magnificat</i> (<i>Luke</i> 1:46-55) which is the song both of the Mother of God and of 
the Church, the joyous thanksgiving that rises from the hearts of the poor 
because their hope is met by the fulfillment of the divine promises.</p>

  <p><b>548.</b>&nbsp;<b>How did the first Christian community in  Jerusalem pray?</b></p>
  <p>2623-2624</p>
  <p>At the beginning of the <i>Acts of the Apostles</i> it is written that in the 
first community of Jerusalem, educated in the life of prayer by the Holy Spirit, 
the faithful "devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles and to the 
communal life, to the breaking of the bread, and to the prayers" (<i>Acts</i> 2:42).</p>
  <p><b>549.</b>&nbsp;<b>How does the Holy Spirit intervene in the Church"s prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2623<BR>2625</p>
  <p>The Holy Spirit, the interior Master of Christian prayer, forms the Church in 
the life of prayer and allows her to enter ever more deeply into contemplation 
of and union with the unfathomable mystery of Christ. The forms of prayer 
expressed in the apostolic and canonical writings remain normative for Christian 
prayer.</p>
  <p><b>550.</b>&nbsp;<b>What are the essential forms of Christian prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2643-2644&nbsp;</p>
  <p>They are blessing and adoration, the prayer of petition and intercession, 
thanksgiving and praise. The Eucharist contains and expresses all the forms of 
prayer.</p>
  <p><b>551.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is "blessing"?</b></p>
  <p>2626-2627<BR>2645&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The prayer of blessing is man"s response to God"s gifts: we bless the Almighty 
who first blesses us and fills us with his gifts. </p>
  <p><b>552.</b>&nbsp;<b>How can adoration be defined?</b></p>
  <p>2628</p>
  <p>Adoration is the humble acknowledgement by human beings that they are creatures 
of the thrice-holy Creator.</p>
  <p><b>553.</b>&nbsp;<b>What are the different forms of the prayer of petition?</b></p>
  <p>2629-2633<BR>2646</p>
  <p>It can be a petition for pardon or also a humble and trusting petition for all 
our needs either spiritual or material. The first thing to ask for, however, is 
the coming of the Kingdom.</p>
  <p><b>554.</b>&nbsp;<b>In&nbsp;what does the prayer of intercession consist?</b></p>
  <p>2634-2636<BR>2647</p>
  <p>Intercession consists in asking on behalf of another. It conforms us and unites 
us to the prayer of Jesus who intercedes with the Father for all, especially 
sinners. Intercession must extend even to one"s enemies.</p>
  <p><b>555.</b>&nbsp;<b>When is thanksgiving given to God?</b></p>
  <p>2637-2638<BR>2648&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The Church gives thanks to God unceasingly, above all in celebrating the 
Eucharist in which Christ allows her to participate in his own thanksgiving to 
the Father. For the Christian every event becomes a reason for giving thanks.</p>
  <p><b>556.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the prayer of praise?</b></p>
  <p>2639-2643<BR>2649</p>
  <p>Praise is that form of prayer which recognizes most immediately that God is God. 
It is a completely disinterested prayer: it sings God"s praise for his own sake 
and gives him glory simply because he is.</p>

  <p>In the Church it is through living Tradition that the Holy Spirit teaches the

  <p>They are: the <i>Word of God</i> which gives us "the surpassing knowledge" of 
Christ (<i>Philippians</i> 3:8); the <i>Liturgy of the Church</i> that proclaims, makes 
present and communicates the mystery of salvation; the <i>theological virtues</i>; 
and <i>everyday situations</i> because in them we can encounter God.</p>

  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE WAY OF PRAYER</font></b></p>
  <p><b>559.</b>&nbsp;<b>In&nbsp;the Church are there different ways of praying?</b></p>
  <p>2663</p>
  <p>In the Church there are various ways of praying that are tied to different 
historical, social and cultural contexts. The Magisterium of the Church has the 
task of discerning the fidelity of these ways of praying to the tradition of 
apostolic faith. It is for pastors and catechists to explain their meaning which 
is always related to Jesus Christ.</p>
  <p><b>560.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the way of our prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2664<BR>2680-2681</p>
  <p>The way of our prayer is Christ because prayer is directed to God our Father but 
reaches him only if we pray " at least implicitly " in the name of Jesus. His 
humanity is in effect the only way by which the Holy Spirit teaches us to pray 
to our Father. Therefore liturgical prayers conclude with the formula: "Through 
our Lord Jesus Christ."</p>
  <p><b>561.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the role of the Holy Spirit in prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2670-2672<BR>2680-2681</p>
  <p>Since the Holy Spirit is the interior Master of Christian prayer and "we do not 
know how to pray as we ought" (<i>Romans</i> 8:26), the Church exhorts us to invoke him 
and implore him on every occasion: "Come, Holy Spirit!"</p>
  <p><b>562.</b>&nbsp;<b>How is Christian prayer Marian?</b></p>
  <p>2673-2679<BR>2682</p>
  <p>Because of her singular cooperation with the action of the Holy Spirit, the 
Church loves to pray to Mary and with Mary, the perfect "pray-er", and to 
"magnify" and invoke the Lord with her. Mary in effect shows us the "Way" who is 
her Son, the one and only Mediator.</p>
  <p><b>563.</b>&nbsp;<b>How does the Church pray to Mary?</b></p>
  <p>2676-2678<BR>2682&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Above all with the <i>Hail Mary,</i> the prayer with which the Church asks the 
intercession of the Virgin. Other Marian prayers are the <i>Rosary</i>, the <i>
Akathistos</i> hymn, the <i>Paraclesis</i>, and the hymns and canticles of 
diverse Christian traditions.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">GUIDES FOR PRAYER</font></b></p>
  <p><b>564.</b>&nbsp;<b>How are the saints guides for prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2683-2684<BR>2692-2693&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The saints are our models of prayer. We also ask them to intercede before the 
Holy Trinity for us and for the whole world. Their intercession is their most 
exalted service to God"s plan. In the communion of saints, throughout the 
history of the Church, there have developed different types of <i>spiritualities</i> 
that teach us how to live and to practice the way of prayer.</p>
  <p><b>565.</b>&nbsp;<b>Who can educate us in prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2685-2690<BR>2694-2695</p>
  <p>The Christian family is the first place of education in prayer. Daily family 
prayer is particularly recommended because it is the first witness to the life 
of prayer in the Church. Catechesis, prayer groups, and "spiritual direction" 
constitute a school of and a help to prayer.</p>
  <p><b>566.</b>&nbsp;<b>What places are conducive to prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2691<BR>2696&nbsp;</p>
  <p>One can pray anywhere but the choice of an appropriate place is not a matter of 
indifference when it comes to prayer. The church is the proper place for 
liturgical prayer and Eucharistic adoration. Other places also help one to pray, 
such as a "prayer corner" at home, a monastery or a shrine.</p>

  <p><b>567.</b>&nbsp;<b>What times are more suitable for prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2697-2698<BR>2720</p>
  <p>Any time is suitable for prayer but the Church proposes to the faithful certain 
rhythms of praying intended to nourish continual prayer: morning and evening 
prayer, prayer before and after meals, the Liturgy of the Hours, Sunday 
Eucharist, the Rosary, and feasts of the liturgical year.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"We must remember God more often than we draw breath."</i> (Saint Gregory of Nazianzus)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>568</b>.<b> What are the expressions of the life of prayer?</b></p>
  <p><b></b>2697-2699</p>
  <p>Christian tradition has preserved three forms for expressing and living prayer: 
vocal prayer, meditation, and contemplative prayer. The feature common to all of 
them is the recollection of the heart.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">EXPRESSIONS OF PRAYER</font></b></p>
  <p><b>569.</b>&nbsp;<b>How can vocal prayer be described?</b></p>
  <p>2700-2704<BR>2722</p>
  <p>Vocal prayer associates the body with the interior prayer of the heart. Even the 
most interior prayer, however, cannot dispense with vocal prayer. In any case it 
must always spring from a personal faith. With the <i>Our Father</i> Jesus has 
taught us a perfect form of vocal prayer.</p>
  <p><b>570.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is meditation?</b> </p>
  <p>2705-2708<BR>2723</p>
  <p>Meditation is a prayerful reflection that begins above all in the Word of God in 
the Bible. Meditation engages thought, imagination, emotion and desire in order 
to deepen our faith, convert our heart and fortify our will to follow Christ. It 
is a first step toward the union of love with our Lord.</p>
  <p><b>571.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is contemplative prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2709-2719<BR>2724<BR>2739-2741<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>Contemplative prayer is a simple gaze upon God in silence and love. It is a gift 
of God, a moment of pure faith during which the one praying seeks Christ, 
surrenders himself to the loving will of the Father, and places his being under 
the action of the Holy Spirit. Saint Teresa of Avila defines contemplative 
prayer as the intimate sharing of friendship, "in which time is frequently taken 
to be alone with God who we know loves us."</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE BATTLE OF PRAYER</font></b></p>
  <p><b>572.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why is prayer a "battle"?</b></p>
  <p>2725</p>
  <p>Prayer is a gift of grace but it always presupposes a determined response on our 
part because those who pray "battle" against themselves, their surroundings, and 
especially the Tempter who does all he can to turn them away from prayer. The 
battle of prayer is inseparable from progress in the spiritual life. We pray as 
we live because we live as we pray.</p>
  <p><b>573.</b>&nbsp;<b>Are there objections to prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2726-2728<BR>2752-2753&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Along with erroneous notions of prayer, many think they do not have the time to 
pray or that praying is useless. Those who pray can be discouraged in the face 
of difficulties and apparent lack of success. Humility, trust and perseverance 
are necessary to overcome these obstacles.</p>
  <p><b>574.</b>&nbsp;<b>What are the difficulties in prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2729-2733<BR>2754-2755</p>
  <p><i>Distraction</i>&nbsp;is a habitual difficulty in our prayer. It takes our attention away from 
God and can also reveal what we are attached to. Our heart therefore must humbly 
turn to the Lord. Prayer is often affected by <i>dryness</i>. Overcoming this 
difficulty allows us to cling to the Lord in faith, even without any feeling of 
consolation. <i>Acedia</i> is a form of spiritual laziness due to relaxed 
vigilance and a lack of custody of the heart.</p>
  <p><b>575.</b>&nbsp;<b>How may we strengthen our filial trust?</b></p>
  <p>2734-2741<BR>2756</p>
  <p>Filial trust is tested when we think we are not heard. We must therefore ask 
ourselves if we think God is truly a Father whose will we seek to fulfill, or 
simply a means to obtain what we want. If our prayer is united to that of Jesus, 
we know that he gives us much more than this or that gift. We receive the Holy 
Spirit who transforms our heart.</p>
  <p><b>576.</b>&nbsp;<b>Is it possible to pray always?</b></p>
  <p>2742-2745<BR>2757</p>
  <p>Praying is always possible because the time of the Christian is the time of the 
risen Christ who remains "with us always" (<i>Matthew</i> 28:20). Prayer and Christian life 
are therefore inseparable:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#663300"><i>"It is possible to offer frequent and fervent prayer even at the market place or 
strolling alone. It is possible also in your place of business, while buying or 
selling, or even while cooking."</i> (Saint John Chrysostom)</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>577.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the prayer of the <i>Hour</i> of Jesus?</b></p>
  <p>2604<BR>2746-2751<BR>2758<o:p></o:p></p>
  <p>It is called the priestly prayer of Jesus at the Last Supper. Jesus, the High 
Priest of the New Covenant, addresses it to his Father when the <i>hour</i> of 
his sacrifice, the <i>hour</i> of his "passing over" to him is approaching. </p>

  <p><b>578.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the origin of the <i>Our Father</i>?</b></p>
  <p>2759-2760<BR>2773</p>
  <p>Jesus taught us this Christian prayer for which there is no substitute, the <i>
Our Father</i>, on the day on which one of his disciples saw him praying and 
asked him, "Lord, teach us to pray" (<i>Luke</i> 11:1). The Church"s liturgical 
tradition has always used the text of Saint Matthew (6:9-13).</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">"THE SUMMARY OF THE WHOLE GOSPEL"</font></b></p>
  <p><b>579.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the place of the <i>Our Father</i> in the Scriptures?</b></p>
  <p>2761-2764<BR>2774</p>
  <p>The <i>Our Father</i> is the "summary of the whole Gospel" (Tertullian), "the 
perfect prayer" (Saint Thomas Aquinas). Found in the middle of the Sermon on the 
Mount (<i>Matthew</i> 5-7), it presents in the form of prayer the essential content of 
the Gospel.</p>
  <p><b>580.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why is it called the "Lord"s Prayer"?</b></p>
  <p>2765-2766<BR>2775&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The <i>Our Father</i> is called the "Oratio Dominica", that is, the Lord"s 
Prayer because it was taught to us by the Lord Jesus himself.</p>
  <p><b>581.</b>&nbsp;<b>What place does the <i>Our Father</i> have in the prayer of the Church?</b></p>
  <p>2767-2772<BR>2776</p>
  <p>The <i>Lord"s Prayer</i> is the prayer of the Church <i>par excellence</i>. It 
is "handed on" in Baptism to signify the new birth of the children of God into 
the divine life. The full meaning of the <i>Our Father</i> is revealed in the 
eucharist since its petitions are based on the mystery of salvation already 
accomplished, petitions that will be fully heard at the coming of the Lord. The
<i>Our Father</i> is an integral part of the Liturgy of the Hours.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">"OUR FATHER WHO ART IN HEAVEN"</font></b></p>
  <p><b>582.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why can we dare to draw near to God in full confidence?</b></p>
  <p>2777-2778<BR>2797</p>
  <p>Because Jesus, our Redeemer, brings us into the Father"s presence and his Spirit 
makes us his children. We are thus able to pray the <i>Our Father</i> with 
simple and filial trust, with joyful assurance and humble boldness, with the 
certainty of being loved and heard.</p>
  <p><b>583.</b>&nbsp;<b>How is it possible to address God as "Father"?</b></p>
  <p>2779-2785<BR>2789<BR>2798-2800&nbsp;</p>
  <p>We can invoke the "Father" because the Son of God made man has revealed him to 
us and because his Spirit makes him known to us. The invocation, Father, lets us 
enter into his mystery with an ever new sense of wonder and awakens in us the 
desire to act as his children. When we pray the Lord"s Prayer, we are therefore 
aware of our being sons of the Father in the Son.</p>
  <p><b>584.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why do we say "our" Father?</b></p>
  <p>2786-2790<BR>2801&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;"Our" expresses a totally new relationship with God. When we pray to the 
Father, we adore and glorify him with the Son and the Holy Spirit. In Christ we 
are "his" people and he is "our" God now and for eternity. In fact, we also say 
"our" Father because the Church of Christ is the communion of a multitude of 
brothers and sisters who have but "one heart and mind" (<i>Acts</i> 4:32).</p>
  <p><b>585.</b>&nbsp;<b>With what spirit of communion and mission do we pray to God as "our" 
Father?</b></p>
  <p>2791-2793<BR>2801</p>
  <p>Since praying to "our" Father is a common blessing for the baptized, we feel an 
urgent summons to join in Jesus" prayer for the unity of his disciples. To pray 
the "Our Father" is to pray with all people and for all people that they may 
know the one true God and be gathered into unity.</p>
  <p><b>586.</b>&nbsp;<b>What does the phrase "Who art in heaven" mean?</b></p>
  <p>2794-2796<BR>2802&nbsp;</p>
  <p>This biblical expression does not indicate a place but a way of being: God 
transcends everything. The expression refers to the majesty, the holiness of 
God, and also to his presence in the hearts of the just. Heaven, or the Father"s 
house, constitutes our true homeland toward which we are moving in hope while we 
are still on earth. "Hidden with Christ in God" (<i>Colossians</i> 3:3), we live already in 
this homeland.</p>
  <p align="center"><b><font color="#663300">THE SEVEN PETITIONS</font></b></p>
  <p><b>587.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the structure of the Lord"s Prayer?</b></p>
  <p>2803-2806<BR>2857</p>
  <p>It contains seven petitions made to God the Father. The first three, more 
God-centered, draw us toward him for his glory; it is characteristic of love to 
think first of the beloved. These petitions suggest in particular what we ought 
to ask of him: the sanctification of his Name, the coming of his Kingdom, and 
the fulfillment of his will. The last four petitions present to the Father of 
mercies our wretchedness and our expectations. They ask him to feed us, to 
forgive us, to sustain us in temptations, and to free us from the Evil One. </p>
  <p><b>588.</b>&nbsp;<b>What does "Hallowed be thy Name" mean?</b></p>
  <p>2807-2812<BR>2858</p>
  <p>To hallow or make holy the Name of God is above all a prayer of praise that 
acknowledges God as holy. In fact, God revealed his holy Name to Moses and 
wanted <i>his</i> people to be consecrated for him as a holy nation in which he 
would dwell. </p>
  <p><b>589.</b>&nbsp;<b>How is the Name of God made holy in us and in the world?</b></p>
  <p>2813-2815</p>
  <p>To make holy the Name of God, who calls us "to holiness" (<i>1 Thessalonians</i> 4:7) 
is to desire that our baptismal consecration animate our whole life. In 
addition, it is to ask "with our lives and our prayers " that the Name of God be 
known and blessed by every man. </p>
  <p><b>590.</b>&nbsp;<b>What does the Church ask for when she prays "Thy Kingdom come"?</b></p>
  <p>2816-2821<BR>2859</p>
  <p>The Church prays for the final coming of the Kingdom of God through Christ"s 
return in glory. The Church prays also that the Kingdom of God increase from now 
on through people"s sanctification in the Spirit and through their commitment to 
the service of justice and peace in keeping with the Beatitudes. This petition 
is the cry of the Spirit and the Bride: "Come, Lord Jesus" (<i>Revelation</i> 22:20).</p>
  <p><b>591.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why pray "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"?</b></p>
  <p>2822-2827<BR>2860</p>
  <p>The will of the Father is that "all men be saved" (<i>1 Timothy</i> 2:4). For this 
Jesus came: to perfectly fulfill the saving will of his Father. We pray God our 
Father to unite our will to that of his Son after the example of the Blessed 
Virgin Mary and the saints. We ask that this loving plan be fully realized on 
earth as it is already in heaven. It is through prayer that we can discern "what 
is the will of God" (<i>Romans</i> 12:2) and have the "steadfastness to do it" (<i>Hebrews</i> 
10:36).</p>
  <p><b>592.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the sense of the petition "Give us this day our daily bread"?</b></p>
  <p>2828-2834<BR>2861</p>
  <p>Asking God with the filial trust of children for the daily nourishment which is 
necessary for us all we recognize how good God is, beyond all goodness. We ask 
also for the grace to know how to act so that justice and solidarity may allow 
the abundance of some to remedy the needs of others. </p>
  <p><b>593.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the specifically Christian sense of this petition?</b></p>
  <p>2835-2837<BR>2861&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Since "man does not live by bread alone but by every word that comes from the 
mouth of God" (<i>Matthew</i> 4:4), this petition equally applies to hunger for the <i>
Word of God</i> and for the <i>Body of Christ</i> received in the Eucharist as 
well as hunger for the Holy Spirit. We ask this with complete confidence for <i>
this day</i> " God"s "today" " and this is given to us above all in the 
Eucharist which anticipates the banquet of the Kingdom to come.</p>
  <p><b>594.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why do we say "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who 
trespass against us"?</b></p>
  <p>2838-2839<BR>2862<o:p></o:p></p>
  <![if !mso]><![endif]>
  <p>By asking God the Father to pardon us, we acknowledge before him that we are 
sinners. At the same time we proclaim his mercy because in his Son and through 
the sacraments "we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins" (<i>Colossians</i> 1:14). 
Still our petition will be answered only if we for our part have forgiven first.</p>
  <p><b>595.</b>&nbsp;<b>How is forgiveness possible?</b></p>
  <p>2840-2845<BR>2862&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Mercy can penetrate our hearts only if we ourselves learn how to forgive " even 
our enemies. Now even if it seems impossible for us to satisfy this requirement, 
the heart that offers itself to the Holy Spirit can, like Christ, love even to 
love"s extreme; it can turn injury into compassion and transform hurt into 
intercession. Forgiveness participates in the divine mercy and is a high-point 
of Christian prayer.</p>
  <p><b>596.</b>&nbsp;<b>What does "Lead us not into temptation" mean?</b></p>
  <p>2846-2849<BR>2863</p>
  <p>We ask God our Father not to leave us alone and in the power of temptation. We 
ask the Holy Spirit to help us know how to discern, on the one hand, between a
<i>trial</i> that makes us grow in goodness and a <i>temptation</i> that leads 
to sin and death and, on the other hand, between <i>being tempted</i> and <i>
consenting</i> to temptation. This petition unites us to Jesus who overcame 
temptation by his prayer. It requests the grace of vigilance and of final 
perseverance.</p>
  <p><b>597.</b>&nbsp;<b>Why do we conclude by asking "But deliver us from evil"?</b></p>
  <p>2850-2854<BR>2864</p>
  <p>"Evil" indicates the person of Satan who opposes God and is "the deceiver of the 
whole world" (<i>Revelation</i> 12:9). Victory over the devil has already been won by 
Christ. We pray, however, that the human family be freed from Satan and his 
works. We also ask for the precious gift of peace and the grace of perseverance 
as we wait for the coming of Christ who will free us definitively from the Evil 
One.</p>
  <p><b>598.</b>&nbsp;<b>What is the meaning of the final <i>Amen?</i></b></p>
